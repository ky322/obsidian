### Chapter 13.1
- Compressibility: Volumes do not change appreciably with increasing pressure
- When a mass of liquid is vaporized there is an increase in volume
- Gases have large compressibility
### Chapter 13.2
- Manometer: Measure pressure of gas
	- Mercury is commonly used as the liquid because it has a high density and unreactive
- Barometer: Measure atmospheric pressure
- The less dense the liquid the taller the column
### Chapter 13.3
- 1 atm = 760 Torr
- P = F/A
- 1 Pa = 1N/m^2
- ![[Pasted image 20240108224705.png]]
- 1atm = 1.01325 bar
### Chapter 13.4
- Boyles Law: Volume of a gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to pressure
	- $V\propto\frac 1 P$
- Charles Law: Linear relationship between volume and temperature at constant pressure
- K = C + 273.15
- V=mT (constant pressure)
	- $m = \frac {V_i} {T_i} = \frac {V_f} {T_f}$
### Chapter 13.5
- Equal Volumes of Gases at the Same Pressure and temperature Contain Equal numbers of Molecules
- Gay Lussac's Law of combining Volumes: Relative volumes of reactants and products are in proportion of whole numbers

### Chapter 13.6
- Avogadro Law: $V\propto n$
- Boyles Law: $V\propto \frac 1 P$
- Charles Law: $V\propto T$
- $V\propto \frac {nT} P$
- Ideal Gas Law: PV=nRT
	- Boyles and Charles Law valid at low pressures; high temperature
	- Gases that satifies this equation are ideal gases
- Equation of State: Equation that relates these to one another P,V,T,n
- R Molar Gas Constant: ![[Pasted image 20240108231935.png]]
### Chapter 13.7
- Ideal gas equation can calculate molecular masses of gases
- M Molar Mass: Number of grams per mole
- Density $\rho = \frac{Mn} V = \frac{MP}{RT}$
- Gas densities are not independent of the identity of the gas allowing for direct determination of molar mass
### Chapter 13.8
- Partial Pressure: Pressure exerted by each gas
- Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure: $P_{total}=P_1+P_2$
- ![[Pasted image 20240109155145.png]]
### Chapter 13.9
- Kinetic Theory of Gases: Calculate the pressure exerted by the molecules as a result of their collisions with the walls of the container
- Kinetic Energy: Energy associated with motion of a body $E_k=\frac 1 2 mv^2$
- More molecules travel at higher speeds at higher temperatures
- Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution: Distribution of molecular speeds in a gas
- Molecules in a gas travel at different speeds they have different kinetic energies
### Chapter 13.10
- Kinetic Theory of Gases
	1. Molecules in a gas are incessantly in motion. They collide randomly with one another and with the walls of the container
	2. All collisions between the gas particles or the walls are elastics so no energy is lost due to heat or friction during collisions
	3. The average distance between the molecules in a gas is much larger than the size of the molecules
		- The gas consists mostly of empty space
	4. Any interactions between molecules in a gas are negligible. Assume molecules in a gas neither repel nor attract one another
	5. The mean kinetic energy of the molecules in a gas is proportional to the Kelvin temperature of the gas
		- $\bar{E_k}=\frac 1 2 M_{kg}\bar{v^2}=cT \rightarrow \bar{E_k}=\frac 3 2RT$ 
- Root mean square: $v_{rms}=\left(\frac{3RT}{M_{kg}}\right)^{1/2}$
### Chapter 13.11
-  Effusion: Relative rates gases leak from a container through one or more holes\
- Graham's Law of Effusion: $\frac{Rate_A}{Rate_B}=\frac{Time_B}{Time_A}=\left(\frac{M_B}{M_A}\right)^{1/2}$
	- Gas molecules most pass directly through the holes of the container without colliding with any other molecules
	- Diameters must be small enough and pressure must be low that the molecules pass through the hole individually so without collision
### Chapter 13.12
- Mean Free Path: The average distance traveled between collisions
- $l=\frac{c}{d^2(N/V)}=\frac{RT}{(\pi\sqrt2d^2N_AP)}$ 
- Collision Frequency: $z=\frac{v_{rms}}{l}$
### Chapter 13.13
- Ideal gas assumes sizes of molecules are 0 and they do not attract each other
- van der Waals Equation: $\left(P+a\frac {n^2} {V^2}\right)(V-nb)=nRT$
- van der Waals constants: a and b whose values depend on the gas
- We now account for molecules of a gas attract and have a finite size and is valid at higher densities and lower temperatures than ideal gas equation
