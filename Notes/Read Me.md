**Routine Sync Process**:

- Whenever you finish editing your notes, commit the changes: `git add .` followed by `git commit -m "A message describing your changes"`.
- Push the changes to GitHub: `git push origin master`
- On any other device, before starting work, pull the latest changes: `git pull origin master`
