### Chapter 5.1
- Schrodinger's
### Chapter 5.2
- n specifies size of an orbital
- l specifies the shape of an orbital
- sharp, principle,  diffuse, fundamental
- Degenerate: Two or more orbitals with the same energy
- n and l = n-1
- s orbital are spherically symmetric
- 2p orbital are cylindrically symmetric about its long axis
- s: l=0, p: l=1, d: l=2, f:l=3
### Chapter 5.3
- m specifies the spatial orientation of an orbital and is in range -l to l
### Chapter 5.4
- Intrinsic Electron Spin
- Spin quantum number: $\frac 1 2, -\frac 1 2$
- 1s =2, 2s = 2, 2p = 6, 3s = 2, 3p =6, 3d = 10, ... 4f = 14
- 2,8,18,32
### Chapter 5.5
- Energy states of atoms with two or more electrons depend on the values of n and l
- $1s<2s<2p<3s<3p<4s<3d\cdots$
### Chapter 5.6
- Pauli Exclusion Principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers
- Spin up and spin down for the spin quantum numbers
- When two electrons occupy an orbital they have their electron spins paired
- A single electron in an orbital has its electron spin unpaired and is an unpaired electron
	- $\uparrow\uparrow$ $\downarrow\downarrow$ are not allowed
- Subshells" groups of orbitals with different l values
### Chapter 5.7
- Electron configuration: Arrangement of electrons in the orbitals
	- $1s^2$ where 2 represents number of electrons
### Chapter 5.8
- Hund's Rule: For any set of orbitals of the same energy for any subshell, the ground state electron is obtained by placing the electrons in different orbitals of this set with parallel spins
- No orbital in the subshell contains two electrons until each orbital contains one electron
### Chapter 5.9
- When an atom absorbs electromagnetic radiation electrons are promoted to excited states
### Chapter 5.10
- A main group atomic cation for which the outermost occupied shell is filled has no valence electrons
- A main group atomic anion for which the outermost ns and np subshells are filled completely has eight valence electrons
### Chapter 5.11
- Transition metal elements depends on their d orbital electrons
### Chapter 5.12
- Atomic radii and Ionization Energies
