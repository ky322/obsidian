### Chapter 3.1
- Reactants: Substances that react with each other
- Products: Substances formed in the reaction
### Chapter 3.2
1. Write down the chemical formulas of the reactants and products. Separate reactants from products with an arrow and the individual reactants and products with plus signs
2. Look for elements that appear once on each side of the equation and adjust balancing coefficients so that the number of atoms of the element on both sides is the same
3. Inspect the remaining elements in turn and balance them as needed
4. Perform a final check of each element in the chemical equation to be sure every element is balanced
5. Add the symbols for states of matters
### Chapter 3.3
- Alkaline: Form corrosive aqueous solutions that feel slippery and react with acids
	- Lithium, sodium, potassium
- Alkaline Earth Metals: Compounds occur in alkaline soil deposits
	- Magnesium, Calcium, Strontium, Barium
- Halogens: React with Metals and nonmetals
	- Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine (also diatomic)
	- Halides: halogens react with alkali metals
### Chapter 3.4
- Periodicity corresponds to missing elements
- Mendeleev's periodic table of elements
- Periodic arrangement of elements by atomic mass
### Chapter 3.5
- Group 1 Metals: Alkali
- Group 2 Metals: Alkaline earth metals
	- Group 1 and 2: All reactive metal that undergoes chemical reactions similar to other members in its group
- Elements in the same column share similar chemical properties
- Group 18: Nobel gases least reactive group
### Chapter 3.6
- Semimetals or metalloids are brittle semi lustrous solids and semiconductors
- Metallic character of the elements, reactivity with nonmetals, increase as we move down a column and to the left
### Chapter 3.7
- Organic compounds: Compounds containing carbon
