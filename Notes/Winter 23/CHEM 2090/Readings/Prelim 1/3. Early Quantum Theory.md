### Chapter 4.1 
- Ionization Energy: Minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom or ion
- First ionization energy $I_1$ is the minimum energy needed to removed an electron from a neutral gaseous atom A to produce a positively charged gaseous ion A+ and an electron e-
- Second ionization Energy $I_2$: Minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a gaseous A+ ion to produce a gaseous A2+ ion
- It is difficult to remove electrons from noble gas atoms
- Alkali metals have low ionization energies
### Chapter 4.2
- Ionization energy increases as we go right and up 
- Valence Electrons: Electrons in the outermost occupied shell of an atom
- Lewis Electron Dot Formula: Representation of valence electrons as dots around an element symbol
### Chapter 4.3
- Electromagnetic Theory of Radiation: All forms of radiation are propagated through space as oscillating electric and magnetic fields
- Wavelength: Distance between successive crests or troughs $\lambda$
- Frequency: Number of crests that pass given point per second $\nu$
- Speed of light $c=\lambda\nu$
### Chapter 4.4
- Continuous Spectrum: Spectrum of white light has no gaps
### Chapter 4.5
- E=h$\nu$ where E is the energy of a quantum of radiation, $\nu$ is the frequency of radiation and $h$ is Planck constant
- Electromagnetic radiation as a beam of particles called photons
### Chapter 4.6
- de Broglie wavelength: $\lambda=\frac h {mv}$
### Chapter 4.7
- Electron diffraction
- X-Ray diffraction
### Chapter 4.8
- Bohr Model: Allowed energy states are stationary states
- Ground State: Stationary state of lowest energy
- Excited State: Allowed state of higher energies
### Chapter 4.9
- When an atom is in a stationary state it does not absorb or emit electromagnetic radiation
- When an atom undergoes a transition from one stationary use to another it emits or absorbs electromagnetic radiation
