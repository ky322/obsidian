### Chapter 4.1 
- Ionization Energy: Minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom or ion
- First ionization energy $I_1$ is the minimum energy needed to removed an electron from a neutral gaseous atom A to produce a positively charged gaseous ion A+ and an electron e-
- Second ionization Energy $I_2$: Minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a gaseous A+ ion to produce a gaseous A2+ ion
- It is difficult to remove electrons from noble gas atoms
- Alkali metals have low ionization energies
### Chapter 4.2
- Ionization energy increases as we go right and up 
- Valence Electrons: Electrons in the outermost occupied shell of an atom
- Lewis Electron Dot Formula: Representation of valence electrons as dots around an element symbol
### Chapter 4.3
- Electromagnetic Theory of Radiation: All forms of radiation are propagated through space as oscillating electric and magnetic fields
- Wavelength: Distance between successive crests or troughs $\lambda$
- Frequency: Number of crests that pass given point per second $\nu$
- Speed of light $c=\lambda\nu$
- $c=2.9979\times 10^8ms^{-1}$
### Chapter 4.4
- Continuous Spectrum: Spectrum of white light has no gaps
-  Rydberg Balmer: Predicts the wavelengths of the lines in the visible spectrum of hydrogen $$\frac 1 \lambda = 1.097\times10^7(\frac 1 4 - \frac 1 {n^2})$$
### Chapter 4.5
- E=h$\nu$ where E is the energy of a quantum of radiation, $\nu$ is the frequency of radiation and $h$ is Planck constant $6.626*10^{-34}Js$
- Electromagnetic radiation as a beam of particles called photons

- $E=\frac {hc} \lambda$
### Chapter 4.6
- de Broglie wavelength: $\lambda=\frac h {mv}= \frac h p$
### Chapter 4.7
- Electron diffraction
- X-Ray diffraction
### Chapter 4.8
- Bohr Model: Allowed energy states are stationary states
- Ground State: Stationary state of lowest energy
- Excited State: Allowed state of higher energies
### Chapter 4.9
- When an atom is in a stationary state it does not absorb or emit electromagnetic radiation
- When an atom undergoes a transition from one stationary use to another it emits or absorbs electromagnetic radiation
- Balmer Series: $E_{photon}=E_i-E_f$
	- Wavelength associated with the transition from initial state to final state
