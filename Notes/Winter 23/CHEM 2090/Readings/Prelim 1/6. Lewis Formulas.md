### Chapter 7.1
- Ionic Bond: One atomic reactant is a metal with a low ionization energy and the other is a nonmetal with a high electron affinity
- Covalent Bond: Bond formed between two atoms by a shared electron pair
- ![[Pasted image 20231223061348.png]]
- Lone electron pairs: Pairs of electrons that are not shared between the chlorine atoms
- Molecular crystal: When $CL_2$ is solidified; the particles are individual molecules
	- Low melting point of most molecular crystals indicates the attraction between the molecules is weak relative to the attraction between ions in an ionic crystal
- Bond length: Certain equilibrium separation distance
### Chapter 7.2
- Octet Rule: Each element forms covalent bonds such that the eight electrons occupy its outer shell
1. Arrange the symbols of the atoms that are bonded together in the molecule next to one another
2. Compute the total number of valence electrons in the molecule by adding the number of valence electrons for all the atoms in the molecule. Account for charge changes if an ion
3. Represent a two electron covalent bond by placing a line between the atoms that are bonded to each other
4. Arrange remaining valence electrons as long pairs about each atom so the octet rule is satisfied for each one
### Chapter 7.3
- Hydrogen is the exception to the octet rule
- ![[Pasted image 20231223070140.png]]
- Hydrogen atom completes its valence shell with two electrons so hydrogen atoms almost form a covalent bond to only one other atom and almost always are terminal atoms
### Chapter 7.4
- Formal Charges: Assign a charge to each atom in a molecule or ion
- Assume each pair of shared electrons is shared equally between the two atoms and assign one of these electrons to each atom
- Formal Charge On An Atom = Total Number of valence electrons in free atom - Total number of lone pair electrons - 1/2 Total number of shared electrons
- We can use formal charges to select one of these Lewis formulas for a molecule over the other
	- Usually the formula with the lower formal charges or least separated formal charges represents the preferred
### Chapter 7.5
- Double Bond: When two atoms are joined by two pairs of electrons
	- Shorter and stronger than single bond
- Triple Bond
### Chapter 7.6
- Resonance: Use of multiple Lewis formulas
- When it is possible to write two or more Lewis formulas without altering the position of the nuclei the formula is viewed as an average of the individual formulas
- Delocalized: The charge of the ion is shared equally by the two oxygen atoms
- Resonance Energy: Difference in Resonance hybrids with delocalized charges have lower energies than their individual resonance forms
- Resonance Stabilization: The energy of the molecule is lower than the energy of any of its hypothetical individual Lewis formulas
### Chapter 7.7
- Free radical: A species with one or more unpaired electrons
	- Very reactive because of the unpaired electrons
- Electron deficient Compounds: Have even number of outer electrons but does not have enough electrons too form octets about each atom
### Chapter 7.8
- Expanded valence shell: Assign extra electrons as lone pairs
- Place extra on element below second row of the period table because it can accommodate more than eight electrons in their valence shells and can bond more than four atoms
### Chapter 7.9
- Electronegativity: Measure of the tendency with which an atom in a molecule attracts the electrons in its covalent bond with other atoms
	- The larger the electronegativity of an atom the greater the attraction of the atom for the electrons in its covalent bonds
- Electronegativities increase from left to right as elements become non metallic
- Decreases going down a column because nuclear attraction of outer electrons decreases as atom increases
### Chapter 7.10
- Pure covalent bond: If electronegativities are the same or less than 0.4 electrons in the bond are shared equally 
- Polar Covalent Bond: If electronegativities of two atoms differ by 0.4 or more the electrons in the bond are not shared equally
- Pure Ionic Bond: If electronegativities of two atoms differ by 2 or more; the electron pair is completely on the more electronegative atom
- Partial Charges $\delta$: Bonding electrons are shifted towards the chlorine atom over the hydrogen atom
- A formal charge of +1 on a very electronegative atom is not reasonable because it tends to gain electrons not lose them
- Negative formal charges should be placed on the more electronegative elements and positive formal charges on the less electronegative elements
### Chapter 7.11
- Dipole Moment: Polarity of a diatomic molecule
	- Arrow going from $-\delta$ to $\delta$
	- Magnitude: Absolute value of the product of the length of the bond and the net charge on either atom
	- Vector
- Polyatomic Molecule: Molecule with more than two atoms; polarity of each bond can be represented by an arrow and is a quantity with both magnitude and direction
	- Bond polarities must have the same vector properties as forces
- Linear Molecule: All three atoms lie in a straight line
- Nonpolar Molecule: No net dipole moment
- Lewis formulas indicate only the bonding within a molecule not the shape of a molecule
