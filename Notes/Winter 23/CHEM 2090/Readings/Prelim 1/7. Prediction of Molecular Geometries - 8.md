### Chapter 8.1
- Stereoisomers: Molecules with the same chemical formula and atom to atom bonding but different spatial arrangements of the atom
	- They are different molecular species and have different chemical and physical properties
- Tetrahedron: Four sided figure that has four equal vertices and faces each one is a equilateral triangle
- Tetrahedral: Molecule whose 3D form is of a tetrahedron
### Chapter 8.2
- Tetrahedral Bond Angle: 109.5
	- The angle between any two vertices of the tetrahedron and a point in the center
- Tetravalent Carbon Bond: Carbon atom bonded to four other atoms
### Chapter 8.3
- VSEPR Theory: The shape of a molecule is determined by minimizing the mutual repulsion of the electron pairs in the valence shells of the central atom
- We only consider the valence electrons directly attached to the central atom
- Linear: Two electron pairs lie at opposite poles of a sphere
- Triangular Planar: Three electron pairs
- Tetrahedral: Four electron pairs
- Trigonal Bipyramidal: Five electron pairs
- Octahedral: Six electron pairs
### Chapter 8.4
- Trigonal Bipyramid
	- Equatorial Vertices: Vertices lying on the equator of the sphere and form an equilateral triangle
	- Axial Vertices: Vertices lying at polar axes and equivalent
		- Not geometrically equivalent to equatorial vertices; has implications
- Octahedron: Eight faces are equilateral triangles
	- Six electron pairs mutually repel one another and is minimized if the six electron pairs point toward the vertices of a regular octahedron; 90 degrees
- Linear: 180, Trigonal Planar: 120, Tetrahedral: 109.5, Trigonal Bipyramid: 90 (Axis to equatorial) and 120 (equatorial to equatorial), Octahedral: 90
