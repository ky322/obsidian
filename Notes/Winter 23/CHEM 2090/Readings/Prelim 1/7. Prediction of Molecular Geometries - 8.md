### Chapter 8.1
- Stereoisomers: Molecules with the same chemical formula and atom to atom bonding but different spatial arrangements of the atom
	- They are different molecular species and have different chemical and physical properties
- Tetrahedron: Four sided figure that has four equal vertices and faces each one is a equilateral triangle
- Tetrahedral: Molecule whose 3D form is of a tetrahedron
### Chapter 8.2
- Tetrahedral Bond Angle: 109.5
	- The angle between any two vertices of the tetrahedron and a point in the center
- Tetravalent Carbon Bond: Carbon atom bonded to four other atoms
### Chapter 8.3
- VSEPR Theory: The shape of a molecule is determined by minimizing the mutual repulsion of the electron pairs in the valence shells of the central atom
- We only consider the valence electrons directly attached to the central atom
- Linear: Two electron pairs lie at opposite poles of a sphere
- Triangular Planar: Three electron pairs
- Tetrahedral: Four electron pairs
- Trigonal Bipyramidal: Five electron pairs
- Octahedral: Six electron pairs
### Chapter 8.4
- Trigonal Bipyramid
	- Equatorial Vertices: Vertices lying on the equator of the sphere and form an equilateral triangle
	- Axial Vertices: Vertices lying at polar axes and equivalent
		- Not geometrically equivalent to equatorial vertices; has implications
- Octahedron: Eight faces are equilateral triangles
	- Six electron pairs mutually repel one another and is minimized if the six electron pairs point toward the vertices of a regular octahedron; 90 degrees
- Linear: 180, Trigonal Planar: 120, Tetrahedral: 109.5, Trigonal Bipyramid: 90 (Axis to equatorial) and 120 (equatorial to equatorial), Octahedral: 90
### Chapter 8.5
- A lone pair of electrons takes up more room around a central atom than a covalent bond
- The repulsion between a lone pair of electrons and the electron pair in a covalent bond is greater than the repulsion between the electron pair in two adjacent covalent bonds
	- Bonds are less than 109.5 as a result
- Whenever C N or O are central atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement each lone pair decreases the remaining bond angles involving adjacent atoms bonded to the central atom by 2 degrees
- The total number of electron pairs in the valence shell of the central atom that determines the geometry of the nuclei in a molecule
- A: central atom, X: atom bonded to central atom, E: lone pair of electrons on central atom
- Ligand: Atom bonded to central atom
- The central atom can be classified as $AX_mE_n$ 
	- m is the number of ligands 
	- n is the number of lone electron pairs in the valence shell of the central atom A
- Steric Number: m+n

### Chapter 8.6
- We count a double or triple bond as one group of electrons connecting the ligand X to the central atom A
- Multiple bonds repel single bonds more strongly than single bonds repel other single bonds
- Multiple bonds act like lone electron pairs
- Different resonance forms of a species always have the same number of electrons around the central atom so VSERP applies to molecules described by resonance hybrids and just one Lewis formula
### Chapter 8.7
- Lone pair electrons occupy the equatorial vertices of a trigonal bipyramid
- Molecules belonging to $AX_4E, AX_3E_2, AX_2E_3$ have lone electron pairs at the equatorial positions
- Interhalogen Compounds: A less electronegative central halogen atom is bonded to more electronegative halogen atoms
### Chapter 8.8
- Two lone electron pairs occupy opposite vertices of an octahedron
- Octahedral: Steric number 6
- To minimize the lone pair-lone pair repulsion two lone pairs must be placed at opposite vertices
### Chapter 8.9
- For a molecule to have a net dipole moment
	1. It must have polar bonds (there must be a electronegativity difference between two or more atoms in the molecule)
	2. The polar bonds must be asymmetric
- Molecules with no net dipole moment are nonpolar molecules
### Chapter 8.10
- Structural Isomers: Molecules that share the same chemical formula but have different bonding or connectivity between the atoms
	- Chemically distinct species with unique physical and chemical properties
- Stereoisomers: Form chemically distinct isomers by changing spatial arrangement of the atoms without altering atom to atom connectivity in a molecule
- Geometrical Isomers: Geometric arrangement of atoms differs about a center
- Optical Isomers: Nonsuperimposable isomers that are mirror images of each other
	- Central atom bonded to four different atoms arranged in tetrahedral geometry
	- Chiral: Molecules exhibiting optical isomerism
	- Test if molecule has four different kinds of atoms bonds to the central atom if so yes
