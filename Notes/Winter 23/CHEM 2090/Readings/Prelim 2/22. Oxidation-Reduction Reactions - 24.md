### Chapter 24.1
- Oxidation Reduction Reactions: Electrons transferred from one species to another
- Driving force is the stability of these ions
- Rules for Assigning Oxidation States
	1. Free elements: 0
	2. The sum of the oxidation states of all the atom sin a species must equal to the net charge on the species
	3. Alkali metal atoms Li Na K Rb Cs +1
	4. Fluorine atoms in compounds -1
	5. Alkaline Earth Atoms Be Mg Ca Sr Ba Ra Zn Cd in compounds +2
	6. Hydrogen atoms in compounds +1
	7. Oxygen atoms in compounds -2
- All else fails
	1. Draw Lewis formula for molecule or ion
	2. Assign all electrons in each bonds to the more electronegative atom in the bond. If equal electronegativities divide bonding electrons equally
	3. Add up total number of valence electrons assigned to each atom
	4. Assign an oxidation state to each main group element in the species
		- Oxidation State = Number of valence electrons in free atom - number of valence electrons assigned to atom in molecule
### Chapter 24.2
- Oxidizing Agent: Reactant that gains electrons
	- Contains atom that is oxidized
	- Oxidization state Increases
- Reducing Agent: Reactant that donates electrons
	- Atom that is reduced
	- Contains atom whose oxidation state decreases
### Chapter 24.3
- Half Reactions: One oxidation process and then the reduction process
- Oxidation Half Reaction: Loss of electrons and electrons appear on the right side
- Reduction Half Reaction: Gain of electrons and electrons appear on the left side
### Chapter 24.4
- To balance oxidation reduction equations in acidic solutions by half reactions
	1. Identify the species oxidized and reduced and then separate the equation into two equations representing the oxidation half reaction and the reduction half reaction
	2. Balance the equation for each half reaction with respect to all atoms other then oxygen and hydrogen
	3. Balance each half reaction with respect to oxygen atoms. Add appropriate number of $H_2O$ molecules to the side deficient in oxygen atoms
	4. Balance each half reaction with respect to hydrogen atoms by adding the appropriate number of $H+$ions to the side deficient in hydrogen atoms
	5. Balance each half reaction with respect to charge by adding appropriate number of electrons to the side with excess positive charge
	6. Make number of electrons supplied by the oxidation half reaction equation equal to the number of electrons consumed by the reduction half reaction
	7. Obtain complete balanced equation by adding two balanced half reaction equations and canceling or combining like terms
- No electrons should appear in the complete balanced equation because electrons are conserved
- Rewrite balanced equation with phases indicated
### Chapter 24.5
- To balance oxidation reduction reaction equations in basic solutions
	4. Balance each half reaction equation with respect to hydrogen atoms by adding a number of $H_2O$ molecules equal to the number of excess hydrogen atoms to the side deficient in hydrogen atoms and an equal number of $OH-$ ions to the side opposite to the added $H_2O$ molecules
### Chapter 24.6
- Oxidation reduction reactions are used in chemical analysis
### Chapter 24.7
- Corrosion
- Galvanization: The process of coating or impregnating iron or steel with zinc
	- The less active metal iron promotes corrosion of the more active metal zinc by providing a metal surface for the reduction of oxygen
