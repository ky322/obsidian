### Chapter 10.1
- Combination Reaction: Reaction of two substances to form a single product
- Ionic Compound: Metal and nonmetal reactants
	- High melting points and formed as solids
- Covalently Bonded Compound: Two nonmetals react
	- More volatile; more readily vaporized than ionic solids and have lower melting and boiling points
- Combustion Reactions: A substance is burned in oxygen or other oxidizer
### Chapter 10.2
- Polyatomic ions remain intact in aqueous solutions
- When a covalent compound is dissolved in water to form a solution the molecules become evenly distributed throughout the solution
- When an ionic compound dissolves in water the species dissociates into positive and negative ions that are surrounded by shells of water molecules in the solution
	- These shells of solvated ions have lower energy than ions in the crystal lattice

- Polyatomic ion: Charged species consisting of two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds
- Oxyanions: Anions involving nonmetals combined with oxygen
1. If a nonmetal forms two possible anions with oxygen the one with the fewer number of oxygen atoms has the suffix -ite and the greater one has -ate attached to the root of the nonmetal's name
2. If a nonmetal forms three possible anions the hypo- and -ite are attached to the nonmetal with the fewest number of oxygen atoms and then follow Rule 1
3. If there is four possible anions per- and -ate is added to the ion with the most oxygen atoms
### Chapter 10.3
- Some metal oxide yields bases and some hydrogen containing compounds yield acids when combined with water
- Base: A compound yielding hydroxide ions OH- when dissolved in water
- Many metal oxide do not react with water and thus do not form basic solutions
	- Inert (unreactive) in water
- Only Group 1 metal oxides and some group 2 metal oxides are the only metal oxides that react with water
- Acid: Compound that yields hydrogen ions H+ when dissolved in water
- Acidic Protons: Hydrogen atoms in the chemical formula of acids that yield H+ ions when the acid is dissolved in water
- Polyprotic acid: acids that have more than one acidic proton
- Oxyacid: Acids containing oxygen
	1. If the name of the anion ends in -ite the acid ends in -ous acid
	2. If the name of the anion ends in -ate the acid ends in -ic acid
- Binary Acids: Consists of two elements and one must be hydrogen
	- Add hydro- to anion -ic acid
- Acidic: Polyatomic acids, binary acids, and soluble organic substances containing functional group -COOH (organic acids)
- Basic solution tastes bitter and feels slippery
- Acid turns blue litmus paper red; Bases solutions turns red litmus paper blue
### Chapter 10.4
- Decomposition Reaction: Breaking apart substance into simpler substances
### Chapter 10.5
- Hydrates: Combination Reaction Between water and anhydrous salt
- The water molecules are bounded to the salt and can be driven off by heating
- To name a hydrate write the name of the anhydrous salt and the Greek prefix of the waters of hydration and add hydrate
- The anhydrous salts are hygroscopic (strongly absorb water)
	- Used as drying agents (desiccants)
### Chapter 10.6
- In single replacement reaction one element in a compound is replaced by another
- Active metals: metals that react with acids
- Acids attack active metals and produce hydrogen gas
### Chapter 10.7
- Metals can be ordered by relative activity based on single replacement reactions
- The more active metal displaces ions of other element from solution
- Metal of greater activity will displace an aqueous metal ion of a less active metal
- Smelting: Production of metals from their ores which are often metal oxides or compounds that are readily convertible to oxides
### Chapter 10.8
- The relative activity of the halogens $F_2>Cl_2>Br_2>I_2$
- The activities of nonmetals increase as we go up within a group except noble gases; contrasting activities of metals which increases as we go down a group
### Chapter 10.9
- In double replacement cations and anions of two ionic compounds exchange to form new compounds
- Precipitate: Insoluble product of a reaction that occurs in solution
- Precipitation Reaction: Double replacement reaction involving formation of precipitate
- The formation of an insoluble precipitate drives precipitation reaction towards the product side of a reaction
1. Most alkali metal salts and ammonium salts are soluble
2. Most nitrates, acetates and perchlorates are soluble
3. Most silver, lead, and mercury I salts are insoluble
4. Most chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble
5. Most carbonates, chromates, sulfides, oxides, phosphates, and hydroxides are insoluble, except for hydroxides of Ba 2+, Ca 2+, and Sr 2+
6. Most sulfates are soluble, except for calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, and strontium sulfate
- Order matters
- Use net ionic equations to describe double replacement reactions that occur in solution
- Spectator ions: Ions present in reaction solution and remain unchanged in product solution
- Write the complete ionic equation and cancel spectator ions to get net ionic equation
### Chapter 10.10
- An acid base reaction is a double replacement reaction
- Formation of a covalent compound from ionic reactants
- The chemical reaction between an acid and base is a neutralization reaction
	- Ionic compound that is formed along with water in neutralization reaction is a salt
- acid + base = water
- Double replacement reactions are driven by the formation of a precipitate or neutral covalent compound from ions of the solution
	- New: Formation of a gaseous covalent product
### Chapter 10.11
- Oxidation Reduction Reactions involves the transfer of electrons between species
- Oxidation reduction reactions or electron transfer reactions: Reactions in which electrons are transferred from one species to another
- Driving force is the stability of these ions
- The atom is oxidized when an atom in a reaction gives up electrons to another species
- Atom is reduced when an atom in a reaction accepts electrons from another species
- Reducing Agent or Electron Donor: Substance that supplies electrons'
- Oxidizing Agent or electron acceptor: Substance that gains electrons
