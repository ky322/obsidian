### Assembly Language
- Assembly Code: Human readable translation of machine code
- Machine Code: Binary encoded instructions describing a program directly executed by processor
- ADD rd, rs, rt `%R[rd]=R[rs]+R[rt]`
	- ADD: Operation
	- rd: destination registor
	- rs: source registor
	- rt: source registor
### Machine Code
- Processor
	- Fetches next instruction from program
	- Decodes instruction
	- Executes according to instruction
	- Repeats
- Program Counter (PC): Keeps tract of where processor is in program
### Instruction Set Architecture ISA
- Contract between hardware and software
- Hardware free to implement it in different ways as long as software can't tell the difference
	- Improvements across processor generations
	- Design choices across product families (high-performance vs low energy)
	- High-performance trickery (out of order execution)
- Software free to use any syntax as long as can be translated into working assembly
### Assembly
- Assembly directly encodes binary instructions
	- Opcodes and operands
- Limitations arise due to size of binary instruction encoding
	- Cannot branch far away or have large literals
	- Can only have few registers
### ARM ISA
- ![[Pasted image 20240216022533.png]]
#### Program Status Register xPSR
- 32 bit register that has three sub registers
	- Application PSR APSR
		- Condition code flag bits negative, zero, Overflow, Carry
	- Interrupt PSR IPSR
		- Holds exception number of currently executing ISR
	- Execution PSR EPSR
		- Thumb state (T=1 when executing Thumb ISA)
- Use MSR and MRS instructions to access
### Condition Codes
- special APSR register holds four one-bit condition codes
	- N: result of last status updating instruction was negative
	- Z: result of last status updating instruction was zero
	- C: last status updating instruction produced carry
	- V: last status updating instruction produced overflow
- "s" suffix means ALU instruction updates APSR
	- SUB vs SUBS
	- Compare instructions CMP, CMN always update APSR
### Instruction Format
- `op <dst> <src1> <src2>`
	- May be fewer source operands and/or no destination
	- Operands may be registers or immediate constants
- `SUB R7, R2, R4; R7 <- R2-R4`
- `ADDS R2 R2 #3; R2 <- R2+3` and updates status flags according to result
- `CMP R2 R4` Updates status flags according to result of `R2-R4`; drop result
- `BNE <label>`(branch if no equal)
	- Jump branch to instruction at position of label in program if status flag $Z\neq0$
	- Operand actually encoded as offset from current position in the program
### Operands
- General purpose registers
	- `R0-R7`: Low registers accessible by all instructions
	- `R8-12`: High registers not accessibly by many 16 bit instructions
	- `R13-15`: Reserved for special purposes
		- R15: Program counter 
		- R14: Link register
		- R13: Stack pointer
- Immediate values
	- Encoded within the instruction format
		- Written as `#VALUE`
		- Limited in size due to instruction encoding
### Summary
- ARM ISA has different versions but we focus on ARMv6-M
- Register configurations
	- Low registers, high registers and R13-15
- Assembly syntax has normal 3 operand configurations
