### I/O Ports
- I/O locations/groups are called ports
	- Read/write
	- Data/Control
- GPIO: General purpose input and output
	- Input: Program can determine if input signal is 1 or 0
	- Output: Program set output to 1 or 0
- Can use interface with external devices
- Signal value is determined by voltage
- Input threshold voltages depend on supply voltage $V_{DD}$
### Accessing I/O Ports
- Special instruction in the ISA for input/output
	- `out (243), A`: Output value stored in register A to port 243
	- `in A, 254`: Read value in port 254 and store in register A
- Special register in ISA for input/output
	- `add $15, $1, $2`: Register 15 is mapped for output operations
	- `add $1, $15, $2`: Register 15 mapped for input operations
	- I/O operation by writing specific values to $15
- Memory mapped I/O
	- Read and write to specific memory locations correspond to I/O operations
- Each pin has its own control register PCR
- MUX control what physical pin is connected to 
- GPIOx_PSOR: Set all bits that are one in n
- GPIOx_PCOR: Clear all bits that are one in n
- GPIOx_PTOR: Invert all bits that are one in n
### I/O In ARM
- I/O is memory mapped
	- Pins are controlled in peripheral space
- GPIO are digital pins
	- Output pins behave like voltage source
	- Input well defined in some voltage regions
- Each physical pin as multiple functions
	- Pins organized by ports
	- Need to set PCR before use
- Need to active ports
	- To save power unused parts of the chip do not receive a clock signal
	- To use peripherals enable them by setting bits in SCGCx
