### Values of Privacy
- Prevent overreach of powerful parties into people's lives
- Allow people to explore new ideas safety without inhibition
	- Uncertainty about privacy chills our access to information even when not watched
- For social functioning so people can interact with each other unreservedly and participate fully in social and political life
- For self fulfillment and actualization
- Theories underlying privacy not so different from underlying speech
### Privacy Harms and the Dead Body Problem
- To win a lawsuit you have to show you suffered a concrete injury
- Harms of having your privacy invaded are hard to define
- "Dead Body Problem": privacy invasions often do not result in dead bodies and are not taken seriously
### Privacy Online and Offline
- More opportunities for data collection
- More record linkage and aggregation within subject and across populations
- Persistence of data
- Reduction of privacy through obscurity
### Privacy Through Obscurity
- Technology reduces obscurity: information used to be harder to find
- Obscurity protects privacy because of the costs of information retrieval
	- Hartzdog The case for online obscurity
- Hartzog's public information fallacy just has private has no fixed meaning neither does public
- People se public to mean I did not break any rules to get this data
- Privacy Paradox: People say they value privacy but give their data away or fail to take privacy protective measures 
### Panopticon
- Conceived as a prison; popularized as a symbol of surveillance
- Key Elements: circle, central watchtower, space around it, oriented to one way visibility, blinds on inspector's lodge, partitions between cells
- Power becomes unverifiable so people police themselves by internalizing the state's gaze
- Foucault shows how this was a big move in how states used power: from spectacular demonstrations of power to this quiet invisible form
### Visibility and Uncertainty
- Even though data collection has moved online visibility and the idea of the panopticon influence how we think about privacy
- Uncertainty plays a key role
- Lantern Laws: Mid 18th century rules that black people had to carry lanterns at night; any white person can stop a person without a lantern to see if they were a runaway slave
- Surveillance is always about power and a tool used most harshly against marginalized groups
### Nothing to Hide Fallacy
- Privacy is not just an individual right but a social one; society with privacy is healthier
- Much can be learned about you even from innocuous information
- Keep things hidden that are not wrong
### Right to Privacy
- There is not a federal omnibus privacy statute
- The first fundamental state of the right to privacy in US is the right to be let alone
	- Warren and Brandeis 1890: The first explicit naming of a right to privacy in US law and extremely influential
	- Most influential law review article ever written
	- Officially proposing a new tort (a wrong for which you can sue a private party called invasion of privacy)
	-
