- Platforms act within an ecosystem that involves lots of relationships and interactions with other parties which impacts policy choices they make 
	- Makes consequences more complicated
### Interactions Between Platforms and their Competitors
- Platforms differentiate themselves by presenting and framing content in different ways
- Content moderation policies and strategies have important roles to play in how platforms differentiate themselves and compete with each other
### Market For Rules
- Internet is a place and who would be in charge of it akin to legal jurisdictions
- Platforms compete based on their local rules about content 
	- Johnson and Post
	- Popular will would be enforced through voting with ones modem not democratic representation
	- If you did not like it you can go elsewhere; consumerist model of law
- Parallel to marketplace of ideas metaphor from truth theory
- Some appeal in recognizing different people want different norms for different interactions
- Avoid normative/ ideological homogeneity
- Assumes harms of speech are bounded to the platform on which they occur
- Is it good for the world if people balkanize into multiple polarized echo chambers (splintenet)
#### Is there a Market for rules
- Sometimes; 8chan known for laxity of moderation
- But not always
	- Companies develop similar practices to what their peers are doing (institutional isomorphism)
	- Policy teams know each other and people move companies
	- Platforms may outsource to same 3rd party moderation services who use common software and people across them
	- Economic: network effects
### Network Effects Disrupts Market For Rules
- For platforms the value of technology to a consumer increases when more people use it 
	- Your benefit comes from others' use (a positive externality)
	- Looking for a ride of Uber, Selling on EBay
- People can easily exit a platform if they do not like the rules
- For the user it becomes more valuable to use and more costly to exit (a dominant platform)
- Hard for new entrant to compete with a dominant player even if its better
- Parallel to critiques of the marketplace of ideas metaphor from truth theory
### Coordinated Content Moderation and De-platforming
- Content cartels: Arrangements between platforms to work together to remove content or actors from their services
- Deplatforming: mixed evidence on effects; reduce reach of messages but also push people to less visible and more radical places
- No First Amendment concerns
- Centralized decision making can create monoculture and make problems systemic; opposite of market for rules
- little transparency about what is in shared databases
- restraint on competition or too much ideological homogeneity
- Address difficulties small platforms have with moderation and let large firms bear the burden
	- Sometimes small platforms fail because they become too popular and cannot keep up with the moderation required
### Section 230 Reform
- Platforms favored Section 230 because it protects them from liability for users' actions on the platform
- Movement from Big Tech for openness to reform
	- Maybe genuine recognition of speech problems online
	- Maybe desire to give a little to prevent complete repeal
	- Maybe as means of competition
- If 230 immunity went away changes in platforms operations
	- Vulnerability to legal liablity
	- More processes to moderate speech; more content moderators hired for ex ante
	- more need to for internal accountability measures, reporting, record keeping
	- More reliance of AI
### Using big P speech policy as competitive tool
- 230 protects platforms and saves them money
- If everyone has to start paying more money they can handle it better than smaller platforms
- Less legal protection could be good for big platforms in terms of increasing barriers to market entry
- 230 reform can increase market consolidation in big tech
- Small platforms may fold together (remove user content, reduce engagement, reduce value to users, drives people to toher platforms)
- 230 goal: Increase innovation and growth in tech sector
- Platforms band together to advocate against 230 reforms that lead to market consolidation
### Interactions Between Platforms and the Stack
- Platforms depend on other services "the infrastructural stack of distribution"
	- hosting, site management and security, app stores, payment processors, domains
- Moderation practices and consequences
	- Infrastructure intermediaries can constrain each other by their own little-p policies (app store rules)
- The further down you go in Infrastructure the fewer alternatives there are and more like a utility these services become
	- Phone company does not decide who you call or what you say on call
