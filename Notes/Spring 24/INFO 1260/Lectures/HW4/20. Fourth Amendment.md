### Fourth Amendment
- Limit government intrusion into private life
- Acting as a check on police power while still providing a procedural emchanism for police to investigate crime
- British authorities used a broad writs of assistance that allowed them to search colonist's home looking for evidence of smuggling or sedition against the king
	- 4th Amendment written in reaction to this concern
- Actively litigated
	- Changing technology impact what this means
- If a police does not get a warrant the search is unreasonable and violates the 4th amendment rights
- Exclusionary Rule: Evidence police find from an unreasonable search could not be used against you in court
	- Anything police learns about later stemmed from search
- A search if a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the situation
	- Requires the Kat Test; Person must have an actual subjective expectation of privacy and expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable
### Reasonable Expectation of Privacy
- Your house and area around your house
- Contents of a letter in an envelop
- Inside your car
- Not resonable
	- View of your house from the street
	- Outside of an envelope or package
	- Things outside your car
### Searching
- Do we have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to technologies that extend human capabilities?
- Kyllo: police use thermovision outside Kyllo's home to see if there were hot lamps growing weed
- Generally you have no expectation of privacy in what can be seen from the street outside your house
	- Seeing inside the house which is private
- This was a search; unusual technology not in general use
	- Concerned about the risk that privacy would be at risk of advancing technology
- Riley: Sheriff flies helicopter 400ft over grand and sees weed
	- Court says no reasonable expectation of privacy
- GPS Monitoring: Jones Cocaine bust
	- 28 days of GPS monitoring is unreasonable search
	- Concerns about how long data was being collecting and constant
### Determining if new Surveillance Tech Violates REP
- Bankston and Soltani look at cost of technology and contrast it with how much surveillance used to cost
- Our privacy expectations are based on what is practical and economically possible
- If new technology is an order of magnitude less expensive than previous technique then it violates reasonable expectations of privacy and is a search under the Fourth Amendment
