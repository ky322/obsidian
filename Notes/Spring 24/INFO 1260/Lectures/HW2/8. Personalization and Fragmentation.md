- Concerns about effects on democratic debate coalesced around the ideas of echo chambers and filter bubbles
	- In a filter bubble there is less room for encounters that bring insight and learning
- Abundance of information
	- Greater heterogeneity of voices and opinions
	- Easy to consume only things that agree with you
		- Finding things on your own and when personalized
- Ranking model tells us to favor items user is likely to choose
- Latent factor model tells us that user selections are guided by genre
- Combining if we show a list of 10 items ranked by probability all 10 will be action movies
	- User thinks of their viewing as 70% action 30% documentary
	- Ranked list of most likely selection 100% action
	- Ranked list maximizes containing user's intended selection
### Empirical Studies
- Challenging to evaluate whether personalization in online platforms leads to increased divergence
	- Hard to measure opinions from decades with same fidelity
	- Hard to separate effect of online tools from broader environment
- Cascade of three filters
	- Similarity to friends: principle of homophily
	- Exposure by news feed algorithm
	- selection by user
### Reflection
- Personalization creates a natural risk of filter bubbles
	- Challenges for serendipity, personal variety, democratic process
	- Empirically complex question
- Cascade of multiple filters: social, algorithmic, individual
- Ranking can distort attention towards the category or genre with largest probability
- Personalization increases heterogeneity between different people's consumptions but reduce it in one's consumption
