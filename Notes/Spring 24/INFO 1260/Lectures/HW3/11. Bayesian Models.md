Can we model the process by which people update their beliefs based on new information?
- Choosing a news source
- Behavioral models suggest that people should favor news source that agrees with them (confirmation bias)
- Models of rational actors who just want information
- Goal: Build a model of agents using the news as a way to form conclusion based on evidence
### Model
- Let A be a claim, E be evidence
- Prior probability Claim is true: P(A)
- Conditional probability claim is true: P(A|E)
- $P(A|E)=P(A)\frac {P(E|A)}{P(E)}$
