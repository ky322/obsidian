Choosing a news source
- Cognitive dissonance from encountering information that clashes with your beliefs about the world
- Confirmation bias is a way of reducing cognitive dissonance
- Implication: people tend to favor news sources that agree with them
Goal: Build a model of agents using the news as a way to form conclusions based on evidence
### Example
- When the economy is doing well the probability that the index takes the value x is a number g(x) increases with x
- When the economy is doing badly the probability that the value x is a number b(x) (decreases with x)
- The news source coarsens the information using a threshold T
- If $x\geq T$ news source writes the economy is doing well
- If $x<T$ economy is doing badly
- New source differentiate themselves based on their choice of threshold T
	- Cheerleader for economy has a low threshold
	- Skeptic has high threshold
- Interpret index directly
	- $P(A)=p, P(E|A)=g(x), P(E|A')=b(x)$
	- $P(A|E)=P(A)\cdot\frac{P(E|A)}{P(E)}$
	- $P(E)=P(A)P(E|A)+P(A')P(E|A')$
- $r(x)=\frac {g(x)}{b(x)}$
- Choose a news source where T equals $x*= r(x) > \frac{1-p}{p}$
- Compared to your preferred news source x*
	- A news source with a higher threshold is too skeptical (gap where you think economy is doing well they would not)
	- A news source with a lower threshold is too cheerleading
- Optimist $P(A)=p_H, r(x_H*)>\frac{1-p_H}{p_H}$ 
- Pessimist $P(A)=p_l<p_H, r(x_l*)>\frac{1-p_L}{p_L}$
	- Threshold is higher
- Optimists listen to optimist sources and likewise for pessimists
- Other sources will be too optimistic or pessimistic but can serve as validators
