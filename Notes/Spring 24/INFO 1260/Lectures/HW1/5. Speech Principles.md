- Rankings affect how attention is allocated
	- They can minimize wasted effort and maximize the chance an impatient user finds something that interests them
	- Tend to increase disparities in attention
	- We do not know enough to build correct rankings so we build them over time as the system evolves
	- Lead to self fulfilling rankings that might not reflect underlying quality of interest
	- All has implications for how we think about which pieces of content succeed in the competition for our attention
- Ranking and personalization of online content raise questions about what information gets attention
	- How valuable is it for different kinds of speech to be heard?
### Free Speech Principles
- The value of free speech
	- Learned Hand: First amendment presupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection‚Äù
- Is truth destined to succeed in the marketplace of ideas?
- Feminist critique: Truth and knowledge are socially constructed ideas shaped by power
- Speech does not really have a truth value
### Democracy Theory
- Goal of free speech is not to reach truth but preserve democracy
- Giving people tools they need for democratic participation while maintaining social stability
- Talking it out as a kind of safety value: presents revolution and allows for gradual change
- Under democracy theory we are most concerned with protecting political speech; some is not high quality
- Talking to others freely is how we develop healthy relationships, communities and selves
### First Amendment
- Schauer: No one normative theory describes what is protected by First Amendment
- Has become a nearly mystical political and cultural symbol with immense rhetorical power
- Relying on the First Amendment is a good way of attracting the attention and sympathy of the press
- Elevate gravity of a situation by framing it as a First Amendment issue
- Speech is protected but government can enact content-neutral restrictions on the time place and manner of speech
- Some kinds of speech are protected to a lesser degree or unprotected (below)
	- Incitement: Brandenburg v Ohio: Speech is protected unless it is likely to provoke imminent violent action
		- Court looks at factors like size of audience, likelihood of harm, imminence and specificity of harm, how people interpret speech, context and relationship between speaker and audience 
	- Defamation: False statements that harm somebody's reputation
		- Different standards apply based on whether person defamed is public or private and if issue is of public or private concern
		- NYT v Sullivan: Ran an ad with errors of APD actions against MLK
- Hate Speech: Protected
	- Lawful but awful
	- Language that is offensive, encourage hate or asserts inferiority of a group is protected by the First Amendment unless it constitutes incitement to violence
- State Action Doctrine: Private companies cannot restrain your speech
- First Amendment only prevents government from restraining your speech
- Freedom of Speech: Whole premise of marketplace of ideas is that not every idea deserves to succeed. Consequences mean the market is working
- With internet more speech, 
	- reduce gatekeeping to production and dissemination of speech, 
	- different ways of finding listeners, 
	- more persistence of speech, 
	- attention scarcity not information scarcity,
	- new questions about how platforms rank, promote, display information and who benefits
