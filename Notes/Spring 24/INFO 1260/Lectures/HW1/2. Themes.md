- Relationship of computational models to the world
- Computing changes the frictions that determine what is easy or hard to do
	- Technology can take things that are possible in principle and make them easy in practice
- The contrast between policy challenges and implementation challenges
	- Difficulty in specify the policy you want or carry out the policy
	- Specify to other people what types of objectionable content you want removed from your platform
	- Create algorithms and governance structures to recognize and take down these objectionable content
- Technical choices are never neutral
	- Technology is inherently political; it enables some actions not others
- Big P Policy and Little P policy
	- Big P Policy: Rules that are issued by the government and backed with the force of law
	- Little p Policy: Company level systems, protocols, and practices implemented by engineers
- Computing systems built in layers
	- The power of computing comes from a commitment to use abstraction barriers
	- Abstraction barriers make it harder to anticipate the consequences of your choice
- Technology and policy is built in layers
- Challenges of anticipating the long-term consequences of technical developments
- The difficulty of locating responsibility when technologies and people interact
	- Whose responsibility is it when people use technology to cause harm to others
- The power of analogical reasoning
	- We reason by analogy about how to govern new technologies
		- Social media like newspaper/newsstand
	- Helpful for stability of social expectation and for predictability of policy implementation
	- Deciding what something should be compared to is hard and potentially limits us to false binaries or path dependence
- Computing problem as a mirror for broader social problems
	- Synecdoche: A literary device where a part stands in for the whole
	- Computing can be a lens to foreground longstanding social problems in a new way
	- Strategic to focus on the technical manifestation of a problem; only part of the bigger problem
- Five Epochs of the Public Internet
	- Pre-History: Creation of the internet and personal computing
	- Creation of the World Wide Web
	- Emergence of high quality web search
	- Dramatic breakthrough in AI for classification: Images, speech and text
	- Creation of generative AI
