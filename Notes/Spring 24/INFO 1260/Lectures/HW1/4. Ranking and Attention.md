### Internet Information and Speech
- A profound problem of abundance: volume of information, ease of creating content with high production values, ease with which interest groups can find each other
- Ranking
	- Choose an order to present options to the users
- Personalization
- Goal: Study ranking using a model
	- User encounters items in the order $I_1,I_2,I_3\cdots$
	- User consumes first item that interests them and leaves the platform
	- If nothing interests them they leave without consuming anything
### Probabilistic Model of User Behavior
- The user encounters a list of ranked items in order $I_1,I_2,\cdots, I_n$
- When they encounter item $I_j$
	- They find $I_j$ interesting with probability $p_j$ independent of decisions about previous items
	- If $I_j$ is interesting they consume it and leave the platform
	- If they do not find $I_j$ interesting they leave the platform with probability $q$
	- Otherwise they move to $I_{j+1}$

### Probabilities
- User rejects $I_1$ and leaves:
	- $(1-p_1)q$
- User consumes $I_2$
	- $(1-p_1)(1-q)p_2$
- User encounters both items but leave
	- $(1-p_1)(1-q)(1-p_2)$
- Probability a user leaves for any reason:
	- $(1-p_1)q + (1-p_1)(1-q)(1-p_2)$
### Rankings Can Maximize Consumption
- Suppose $I_1$ is more appealing than $I_2, p_1>p_2$
- Expected number of users who fail to consume $I_1$ first: $n(1-p_1)q + n(1-p_1)(1-q)(1-p_2)$
- Expected number of users who fail to consume $I_2$ first: $n(1-p_2)q + n(1-p_2)(1-q)(1-p_1)$
- When users are impatient show the most appealing items first
- When we question this conclusion
	- Weighted measures of consumption
	- Users might be willing to consume multiple items
	- We care about things other than consumption
### Ranking Increase Disparities in Attention
- Baseline for disparity in attention
	- Show $I_1$ to half the users and $I_2$ to other half
	- Expected consumption: $\frac {np_1} 2, \frac {np_2} 2$
	- Ratio: $\frac {p_2} {p_1}$
- Relative attention in ranking
	- $n(1-p_1)(1-q)p_2$
	- Ratio: $(1-p_1)(1-q)p_2/p_1$
		- Smaller than baseline
- Position Bias: Tension between highlighting most appealing content and creating disparities in attention
- Rankings can be self fulfilling
	- Run experiments
	- Leaderboard or any ranking can be self-fulfilling
	- Is top item the best or did it et lucky at first
	- Path dependence: random early events have an outsized effect
### Cultural Production
- Computing as synecdoche: Online rankings are one form of filter that cultural products must pass through
- These filters operate like rankings and exhibit ranking phenomena
	- Maximize consumption
	- Massive disparities in attention
	- Become self-fulfilling: cumulative advantage
- Experiment: MusicLab
### Ranking and Attentions
- Rankings affect how attention is allocated
	- Minimized wasted effort
	- Increase disparities in attention
	- We don't know the right ranking in advance so we build them over time as the system evolves
	- Can lead to self fulfilling rankings that might not reflect underlying quality of interest
- All of this has implications for which pieces of content succeed in competition for our attention
