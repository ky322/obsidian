- String Distance: Distance between two strings is a measure of how alike two strings are to each other
- Minimum Edit Distance: Minimum number of editing operations needed to transform one string into other
- Levenshtein Distance: Simplest weighting factor in which each of the three operations have a cost of 1
	- Alternative: substitution with cost of 2
- Edit Distance matrix: one column for each symbol in target sequence and one row for each symbol in source sequence
	- Each cell `e[i,j]` contains distance between first i characters of the target and first j of the source

- If two symbols occur in the same row there is an insertion in going from the source to target
- Two symbols in the same column is deletion
- When filling out the matrix take the min value and add 1
	- If it is the same letter just take min value
- We can backtrack to find operations by following min values
