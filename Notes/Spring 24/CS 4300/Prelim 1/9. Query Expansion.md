	- More robust
- Use grammatical analysis if text
	- More accurate
- Compute cooccurrence thesaurus based on term-term similarities
	- Term document matrix A
		- $A_{t,d}$: weighted count $w_{t,d}$ for term t and d
	- $C=AA^T$: $C_{u,v}$ is a similarity score between $u, v$
- May decrease precision
