### Term Frequency and Weighting
- Assign to each term in a document a weight for that term that depends on number of occurrences of term in document
- Compute a score between query term t and document d based on weight of t in d
	- Term Frequency $tf_{t,d}$: Weight is number of occurrences of t in d 
- Bag of Word Model: Ordering of terms is ignored but number of occurrences of each term is material
#### Inverse Document Frequency
- Term frequency all terms are considered important when assessing relevancy on query
	- Scale down term weights of term with high collection frequency (total number of occurrences of a term in the collection)
	- Reduce tf weight of a term by a factor that grows with its collection frequency
- Document frequency $df_{t}$: Number of documents in collection that contains t
	- Better to use document level stat instead of collection
- Inverse Document Frequency: $idf_t=\log\frac N {df_t}$
	- idf of rare term is high and idf of frequent term is low
#### Tf-idf Weighting
- Composite weight for each term in each document
- tf-idf weighting scheme assigns term t a weight in d: $tf-idf_{t,d}=tf_{t,d}\times idf_t$
- Assigns to term t a weight in d that is
	- Highest when t occurs many times within a small number of documents
	- Lower when term occurs fewer times in a document or in many documents
	- Lowest when term occurs in all documents
- Overlap Score Measure: Score of d is sum over all query terms of number of times each query term occurs in d 
	- $Score(q,d)=\sum_{t\in q}tfidf_{t,d}$
### Vector Space Model For Scoring
- Document vector captures relative importance of terms in document
- Euclidean: Two documents with similar content can have a significant vector difference because one is longer than the other
	- Distribution of terms may be same but absolute term frequencies are larger
- Cosine: system where user may identify a document and seek others like it
- Term document Matrix MxN where rows are M terms and column of N documents
#### Queries as Vectors
- Assign each document d a score equal to dot product $\vec{v}(q)\cdot\vec{v}(d)$
- $Score(q,d)=\frac{\vec{v}(q)\cdot\vec{v}(d)}{|\vec{v}(q)||\vec{v}(d)|}$
- Document may have high cosine score for a query even if it does not have all query terms
#### Computing Vector Scores
- We seek the K documents of the collection with the highest vector space scores on the given query
- K top documents in ordered by decreasing score
### Variant tf-idf Functions
- Unlikely that twenty occurrences of a term in a documents carry twenty times significance in single occurrence
- Use log of term frequency which assigns weight by $$wf_{t,d}=\begin{cases}1 +\log tf_{t,d} \space\text{if} tf_{t,d}>0\\0\end{cases}$$
- wf-idf = $wf_{t,d}\times idf_t$
