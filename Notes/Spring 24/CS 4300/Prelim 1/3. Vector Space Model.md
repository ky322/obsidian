- Lexicon free FST: The Porter Stemmer
- Vector Space Model: documents and queries are vectors of features representing the terms (words) that occur within the collection
	- Term Weight: Value of each feature and a function of term's frequency in documents
- Document $\vec{d_j}=(w_{1,j}, w_{2,j},\cdots, w_{n,j})$
	- $\vec{d_j}$: document
	- Vector: Weight feature for each of the N terms that occur in the collection
	- $w_{2,j}$: weight that term 2 has in document j
- Query $\vec{q}=(w_{1,q}, w_{2,q},\cdots, w_{n,q})$
	- N: the number of dimensions in vector and total number of terms in collection
- Cosine: $sim(\vec{q}, \vec{d_j})=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_{i,q}\times w_{i,j}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_{i,q}^2}\times\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^Nw_{i,j}^2}}$
	- If two documents are identical: cosine of 1
	- If orthogonal (share no common terms) cosine of 0
- Cosine is normalized dot product
	- Dot product between two vectors divided by lengths of two vectors
- Term by document Matrix: Characterization of documents of vectors of term weights allow us to view document collection as a whole as a matrix of weights where $w_{i,j}$ is the weight of a term i in document j
	- Columns are documents
	- Rows are terms
