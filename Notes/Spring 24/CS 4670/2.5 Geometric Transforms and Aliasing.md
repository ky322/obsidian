### Modeling Camera
- Perspective Projection: $\vec{x}_{\text{img}}\equiv K\begin{bmatrix}R & \vec{t}\end{bmatrix}\vec{x_w}$
	- Perspective Projection and Moving or Rotating Camera: $\begin{bmatrix}R & \vec{t}\end{bmatrix}$
	- Multiply right to left with $\vec{x}_w$
		- $\begin{bmatrix}R & \vec{t}\end{bmatrix}$: 3D to 2D pixel coordinates
		- K: Intrinsic part of modern digital cameras
			- Conversion from meters to pixels
			- Rescale x and y coordinates to get x' and y' 
			- $x'=sx, y'=sy$
			- Homogenous coordinates
				- $\begin{bmatrix}sx\\ sy\\1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}s &0 &0\\ 0 &s&0\\ 0 & 0 &s\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\\1\end{bmatrix}$
### Optical Zoom
- K: Optical zoom where camera moves lens away from image plane
	- Increase distance from pinhole to image plane increases image size
- $f$: Focal length
	- Want image focused on image plane
	- Compute new coordinates where 3D point $(X,Y,Z)$ lands
		- Points along a ray $(\lambda X, \lambda Y, \lambda Z)$
		- $z=-f\to\lambda=\frac{-f}{Z}$
- When image plane is 1 unit away from lens $x=\frac X Z, y=\frac Y Z$
	- With a focal length of $f$ $x'=fx, y'=fy$
	- New image coordinates are f times the old image coordinates $K=\begin{bmatrix}f &0 &0\\ 0 &f&0\\ 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}$
### Geometric Transformations in Software
- K models transformation to pixels and optical zoom and anything camera does between capturing image and returning it
	- Zoom, translation, rotation, resizing
- $\begin{bmatrix}x'\\ y'\\1\end{bmatrix}=K\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\\1\end{bmatrix}$
- K takes the input image coordinate to find the output image coordinate
- More generally: $\begin{bmatrix}x'\\ y'\end{bmatrix}=T(\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix})$
- If coordinate $(x,y)\to(x',y')$ by $(f'(x',y'))=f((x,y))$ where f is the input and f' is the output they must be integers
- Compute $x'$ and $y'$ with forward transformation using $(x,y)$ from original image to compute where output coordinates are 
- Instead $\begin{bmatrix}x\\ y\end{bmatrix}=T^{-1}(\begin{bmatrix}x'\\ y'\end{bmatrix})$
	- $x'$ and $y'$ are integers and x and y can have continuous values
### Interpolation
- Reconstruct underlying continuous function from discrete samples
- Assume smoothness about underlying sample $f(x+\Delta_x, y+\Delta_y)\sim f(x,y)$
- We can use value of nearest sample
- Bilinear: Weighted average of four nearest neighbors and weight is area of opposite rectangle
	- Weight is largest when red dot on point
	- Influence of point should be at minimum when red dot is on point
- Gaussian: Values at the new pixel a weighted combination of known pixels with the weight equal to the negative exponential of squared distance $g(x, y) = C \sum_{x'} \sum_{y'} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - x')^2 + (y - y')^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) f(x', y')$
- $g(x, y) = C \sum_{x'} \sum_{y'} w(x - x', y - y', \sigma) f(x', y')$
### Up Sampling
- Zooming into an image
- Example: Up sample by two we double its size, increase resolution
- NN: Grid like artifacts caused by interpolation changing discontinuously
- Bilinear interpolation reconstructs smoother version of signal
	- When up sampling factor is high bilinear can result in grid artifacts
- Zoom cannot recover additional details not in original photo
- Information not represented in original signal cannot be restored
