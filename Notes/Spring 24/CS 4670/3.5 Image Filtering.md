### Filtering
- Convolution and cross correlation are linear
	- $(aw+bv)\otimes f= a(w\otimes f)+b(v\otimes f)$
- Applying convolution and linearly combining the result is the same as linearly combining inputs and then applying convolution
### Sharpening
- Applying a mean filter blurs input image
- Linearity and associativity of convolution can develop a kernel that sharpens images
	- Enhances difference between pixel and its neighbor
- Blurring: Details are lost
	- Differences that were removed by blurring by subtracting blurred image from original
	- Adding differences back to original enhances details
- Identity kernel $w$ and mean filter $v$ we can represent transformation from original image $f$ as a linear combination of filters
	- Single filter that performs sharpening
	- $f_s=f+\alpha(f-f_b)\to((1-\alpha)w-\alpha v * f)$
- Convolution: Shift invariant, commutative, full convolutions are associative
	- Full convolution image is padded with zeros o apply kernel whenever it intersects with image
		- $a(b*c)=(a*b)c$
	- Convolving kernel $w$ with $f$ and convolving kernel $v$ with $f$ equals convolving the two kernels v with w and then convolving with f
		- Used in large images where two big convolution operations can be reduced to one convolution of two small kernel to produce a single filter and one convolution with a large image
- Shift invariance: Detect cat below independent of position in image
- Linearity: Linear functions are predictable when input change 
	- Linear shift invariant operations can be expressed as a convolution
