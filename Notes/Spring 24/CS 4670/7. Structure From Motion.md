- Given two or more images from unknown cameras and with 3D world unknown
	- Can we recover camera and 3D world structure
- To recover 3D we need to know the camera location and orientation
- If corresponding pixel are in the same row then we know what the cameras are
1. Get Correspondences
2. Estimate Essential matrix and get R and t
3. Use calibrated cameras and correspondence to get 3D locations of points
4. Optimize camera parameters and 3D locations to minimize reprojection error
### Epipolar Constraint
- Corresponding pixels are on the epipolar line
- For a single camera pixel in image plane must correspond to point somewhere along a ray
- When viewed in second image ray looks like a line, epipolar line
- Epipolar lines must pass through image of the first camera in the second image, epipole

- Reduces correspondence problem to 1D search along an epiolar line

- Epipolar plane: Camera centers corresponding points and screen point lie in a single plane
### Epipolar pencil
- Epipolar Pencil: As X varies the epipolar planes rotate about a baseline, the family of planes
- All epipolar lines intersect at the epipole
- $\vec{x}_{\text{img}}\cdot\vec{t}\times R\vec{x}_{\text{img}}=0$
	- $a\cdot b=a^Tb$
	- $[t]_\times a=t\times a$
	- ![[Pasted image 20240307030222.png]]
- If $\vec{p}$ is a pixel in the first image and $\vec{q}$ is the corresponding pixel in the second image $\vec{q}^TE\vec{p}=0$
	- $E=[\vec{t}]_\times R$
- For a fixed $\vec{p}, \vec{q}$ must satisfy $\vec{q}^T\vec{I}=0, \vec{I}=E\vec{p}$
	- Epipolar line in second image
- For a fixed $\vec{q}, \vec{p}$ must satisfy $\vec{I}^T\vec{p}=0, \vec{I}=E^T\vec{q}$
	- Epipolar line in first image
### Fundamental Matrix
- $q^TFp=0$
- $Fp$: Epiolar line associated with p
- $F^Tq$ epiolar line associated with q
- $Fe_1=0, F^Te_2=0$
- F is rank two
### F8 Point
- F $x'Fx=0$
