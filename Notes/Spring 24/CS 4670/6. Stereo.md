### Binocular Stereo
- General Case: Cameras can be arbitrary locations and orientations
- If we know where cameras are we can shoot rays from corresponding pixels and intersect
### Triangulation
- Suppose we two cameras and a pair of corresponding pixels we can find 3D location of point
	- Calibrated parameters known

- 1 image gives 2 equation
- we need two images
- Solve linear equations to get 3D point location

### Linear and Non Linear Optimization
- Reprojection error: Squared error between the true image coordinates of a point and the projected coordinates of hypothesized 3D point
	- Actual error we care about
	- Minimizes total sum of reprojection error across all images
	- Non-linear optimization
### Binocular Stereo
- General Case: Cameras can be arbitrary locations and orientations
- Special Case: Cameras are parallel to each other and translated along the x axis
	- Stereo with rectified cameras
### Perspective Projection in Rectified Cameras
- Assume origin is at pinhole of 1st camera
	- $\vec{x}_{\text{img}}\equiv \begin{bmatrix}I & \vec{0}\end{bmatrix}\vec{x_w}$
	- $\vec{x}_{\text{img}}\equiv \begin{bmatrix}I & \vec{t}\end{bmatrix}\vec{x_w}$
	- $\vec{t}=\begin{bmatrix}t_x\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}\vec{x}_w=\begin{bmatrix}X\\ Y\\ Z \\ 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}x_w\\1\end{bmatrix}$
- X coordinate differs by $\frac{t_x}{Z}$ 
	- $x_1=\frac X Z, x_2=\frac{X+t_x}{Z}$
	- Inversely proportional to depth
	- Disparity: Difference in X coordinate
		- Baseline/depth
	- Baseline: Translation between cameras (tx) 
- Y is same
	- $y_1=\frac Y Z, y_2=\frac{Y}{Z}$
### NCC
- ![[Pasted image 20240307024501.png]]
- Consider a MxN image with D possible disparities
	- For every pixel D possible scores
	- Can be written as a MxNxD array
	- To get disparity take max along 3rd axis
### Compute NCC Volume
- For every pixel (x,y)
	- For every disparity d
		1. Get normalized patch from image 1 at (x,y)
		2. Get normalized patch from image 2 at $(x+d,y)$
		3. Compute NCC
