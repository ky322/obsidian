### Modeling Camera
- Action of Camera: $\vec{x}_{\text{img}}=[R\space\vec{t}]\vec{x}_w$
- $[R t]$
	- Effect of moving/rotating camera
	- Perspective projection
- K
	- Anything the camera does between capturing an image and returning it
	- Optical or digital zoom
	- Any further geometric image manipulations: zoom, translation, rotation
### Changing Units
- x in pixels = x in meters * s
- x' = sx
- y'= sy
### Geometric Transformation
#### Zooming
- Given $(x,y)$ in input where is the corresponding pixel in output
	- $x'=cx, y'=dy$
- Many geometric transformation can be represented as K
	- $\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\\1\end{bmatrix}\equiv K\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\1\end{bmatrix}$
- $\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\\\end{bmatrix}= T(\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix})$
- Where does pixel $(x,y)$ in the original image go to in output image
	- If $(x,y)$ goes to $(x',y')$ then $f'(x',y')=f(x,y)$ where f is input and f' is output
### Forward and Inverse Transformation
- Forward
	- Given $(x,y)$ in original image where does it go to in the output $\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\\\end{bmatrix}= T(\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix})$
- Inverse
	- Given $(x,y)$ in output image where does it come from in input $\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\\end{bmatrix}= T^{-1}(\begin{bmatrix}x'\\y'\end{bmatrix})$
	- For every pixel $(x',y')$ in output figure out where in input to copy from
### Interpolation
- Image pixels are discrete samples from an underlying continuous function of x and y
	- Smooth in some way
- $f(x+\Delta_x, y+\Delta_y)\sim f(x,y)$
- Value is same as that of nearest sample
### Bilinear Interpolation
- Find four nearest neighbors
- Compute weighted average of four
- Gaussian Interpolation: Set new pixels to be weighted combination of known pixels with weight = -exp(sq distance)
### Aliasing
- By subsampling we miss information between samples
- If underlying function changes a lot between samples we miss all of that variation
- Function reconstructed from samples will have a lot less variation
### Frequency
- If $f(x,y)$ changes rapidly with x and y f has high frequencies
- If a function has high frequency components subsampling might miss peaks and troughs of high frequency components
	- Appear aliased as low frequency components
- Nyquist Sampling Theorem: To avoid aliasing frequency of sampling should be greater than twice the greatest frequency in signal
#### Fourier Transform
- Every 1D function f(x) can be decomposed into a set of sines and cosines
- Higher the w the higher the frequency
- If constructing f(x) requires sin waves of high frequency to places where it changes rapidly
### Subsample
- If image has high frequency components they appear aliased as other low frequency components
- Remove high frequency components
	- Implies pixels vary quickly with x and y
	- Pixels are unlike neighbors
	- Make more like neighbors
### Mean Filtering
- Replace pixel by mean of neighborhood
- $S[f](m,n)=\sum_{i=-1}^1\sum_{j=-1}^1w(i,j)f(m+i,n+j), w(i,j)$ filter
### Gaussian Filter
- Ignore factor in front normalized filter to sum to 1
- $G_\sigma(x,y)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^-{\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\sigma^2}}$
- Filter image then subsample
