- Hex to Decimal: $0x13FE=1*16^3+3*16^2+15*16+14*16^0=5118$
- Hex and Binary: $(0001)(0011)(1111)(1110)$
- Kilobyte: $2^{10}$
- Megabyte: $2^{20}$
- Gigabyte: $2^{30}$
### Stack Data Structure
- Save data for later
- Points to top of stack
- Stack grows down
- High to low memory
#### Example
- PUSH 0x7
	- Decrement SP by 0x4
	- Write 0x7 to SP
- PUSH 0x50
	- Decrement SP by 0x4
	- Write 0x7 to SP
- POP the Stack
- Load the value at the stack point (0x50)
- Increment SP by 0x4
### Interrupt
1. Switch to kernel/supervisor mode
2. Disable interrupts
3. Save key registers (SP, PC) to temporaries then switch to KSP
4. Pushes key registers onto interrupt stack (SP, PC, PSW)
5. Sets PC to handler address in interrupt vector
6. Push general purpose registers onto stack
7. Handle the interrupt
8. Pop general purpose registers off stack
9. Invoke RFI instructions
	- Pop SP, PC, PSW
	- Enable interrupts
	- Switch to user mode
### Interrupt Processing
1. Handle interrupt
2. Remove cause
3. Restore what was running before interrupt
	1. State may have been modified on purpose
- Two actors in handling the interrupt
	- Hardware goes first
	- Kernel code takes control in interrupt handler
- Two stacks involved
	- User stack may be not large enough
	- User could use SP for other things
	- Security
### Summary
- Kernel is code running in supervisor mode
- Process is code running in user mode
- Each process has its own segments (code, data, heap, stack) and its own registers (pc, sp, r1, r2)
- Switching between modes
	- User mode to supervisor mode
		- Signal: Interrupt, system call, exception fault
	- Supervisor mode to user mode
		- Return from interrupt instruction
