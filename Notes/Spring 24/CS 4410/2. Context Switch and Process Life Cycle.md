### States of Life Cycle
- Init: Inital state of a process where it has been created but not yet admitted to run queue
	- PCB: being created, Registers: Uninitialized
- Runnable" Once process is admitted to run queue; it is ready to be executed by CPU
	- On ready queue; pushed to kernel stack
- Running: Process actively executing instructions on CPU
	- Not on queue; popped from interrupt stack onto user stack
- Waiting" Wait for an event 
	- On the specific queue for the thing the process is waiting for; pushed onto interrupt stack
- Finish: Completed execution
### Starting a New Process
- Allocate and Initialize PCB
- Set up initali page table (initalize new address space)
- Load program into address apce
- Allocate user level and kernel level stacks
- Copy arguments to top of user level stack
- Simulate interrupt init to ready
	- Push kernel stack PC user SP
	- Pysh PSW supervisor mode off interrupts enabled
- Clear regsisters
- Return from interrupt ready to running
### System Call
1. Invoke system call
2. Sets syscall type in register
3. Execute syscall instructions
4. Place result in register
5. Invoke RFI
6. Return from library function
