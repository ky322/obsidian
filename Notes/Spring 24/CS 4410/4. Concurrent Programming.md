### OS is Concurrent Program
- Mutitasking: Run multiple processes concurrently
- Resource allocation: memory CPU time through scheduling algorithms
- I/O Operations
- Interrupts: network interrupt, clock interrupt, system calls
### Non Determinism in Harmony
- Thread interleaving
- Choose expressions
- interrupts
### Increment is Not Atomic
- Atomic: indivisibule, cannot overlap
### Race Conditions
- timing dependent error involving shared state
- once a thread starts it needs to race to finish
- Whether race condition happens depends on thread schedule
- All possible interleavings and thread schedules should be safe
- Race conditions are hard to debug
### Critical Section
- Instructions where only one thread is allows to execute at a time
- Useful when accessing shared data structure
- Mutual Exclusion: There can never be two threads in critical section
- Progress: Thread will eventually get into critical section
