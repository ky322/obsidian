- Mechanism: context switch between processes
- Policy: Scheduling which process to run next
### Kernel Operation
- Initialize devices
- Initialize firsrt process
- while true
	- while device interrupts pending handle device interrupts
	- while system calls pending handle system calls
	- If run queue not empty select process and switch to it
	- Otherwise wait for device interrupt
### Schedulers
- CPU Scheduler: Selects process to run from run queue
- Disk Scheduler: Selects next read and write operation
- Network Scheduler: Selects next packet to send or process
- Page Replacement Scheduler: Selects page to evict
### Process Model
- Processes switch between CPU and I/O bursts
- CPU Bound Process (Matrix Multiply): Long CPU burst
- I/O Bound Process: Short CPU Burst
### CPU Burst Prediction
- Approximate duration of next CPU burst based on durations of past burst
- $\tau_{n+1}=\alpha\tau_n+(1-\alpha)t_n$
	- $\tau_{n+1}:$ predicted duration of n+1 CPU burst
	- $\tau_n$ predicted duration of nth CPU burst
	- $t_n$ actual duration of nth CPU burst
	- $\alpha,  0\leq\alpha\leq1$: Weight placed in past 
### Job
- Task that needs a period of CPU time
- Job Arrival Time: When job was first submitted
- Job Execution Time: Time needed to run task without contention
- Job Deadline: When task must be completed
- Execution Time: Sum of Green periods
- Total waiting time: Sum of Red Periods
- Turnaround Time: Sum of Both
### Performance
- Turnaround Time: User perceived time to complete some job
- Response Time: When does it start? User perceived time before first output
- Total Waiting Time: Time on the run queue but not running
- Throughput: Rate of job completion
- Predictability: Low variance in turnaround time for repeated jobs
- Overhead: Time lost due to switching between jobs
- Fairness: Equality in resources given to each job
- Starvation: Lack of progress for one job due to resources given to higher priority jobs
### The Perfect Scheduler
- Minimizes response time and turnaround time for each job
- Maximizes predicable performance and overall throughput and utilization
- Meets all deadlines
- No one starves
- No job wants to switch its schedule with another
- Zero overhead
### When Does Scheduler Run
- Non-preemptive
	- Job runs until it voluntarily yields CPU
	- Process needs to wait
	- Process explicitly yields
	- process terminates
- Preemptive
	- All of above
	- Timer and other interrupts 
		- When jobs cannot be trusted to yield explicitly
	- Incurs overhead
### Context Switch Overheads
- Cost of saving registers
- Cost of scheduler determining the next process to run
- Cost of restoring registers
	- Some caches may need to be flushed
### Scheduling Algorithms
- First in first out
	- Simple, low overhead, no starvation
	- Average turnaround time very sensitive to scheduler order
	- Not responsive to interactive jobs
- Shortest job first
	- Optimal average turnaround time
	- Pessimal variance in turnaround time
	- Needs estimate of execution time
	- can starve long jobs
- Earliest deadline first
	- Does not need to know execution times of jobs
	- Meets deadlines if possible
	- Free of starvation
	- Does not optimize other metrics
	- Cannot decide when to run jobs without deadlines
- Round Robin
	- Each job can run for a quantum (some configured period of time)
	- Context is switched at the latest at the end of the quantum (preemption)
	- Next job is the one on the run queue that has not run for the longest amount of time
	- Good quantum size
		- Too long becomes FIFO
		- Too short: time wasted on context switching
		- Typically 100X cost of context switch
	- No starvation
	- Can reduce response time
	- Context switch overhead
	- Mix of I/O and CPU bound
	- Bad average turnaround time for equal length jobs
- Shortest remaining time first
### Priority Scheduling
- Assume a number to each job and schedules in increasing order
- can implement any scheduling policy
- Reduces to SJF if $\tau_n$ (estimation of execution time) is used as priority
### Priority Inversion
- Problem: Some high priority process is waiting for some low priority process
- Solution: High priority process (need lock) temporarily donates priority to lower priority process with lock 
### Avoid Starvation
- Improve job's priority with time 
- Select jobs randomly weighted by priority
### Completely Fair Scheduler CFS
- Spent Execution Time: Time process has been executing
- Scheduler selects process with lowest SET
- $\Delta$ Time
- N number of processes on run queue
- Process runs for $\Delta/N$ time
- If it uses up this quantum reinsert into queue $SET+=\Delta/N$
- If a process is new of it sleeps and wakes up then its new SET is the max of its old SET and the minimum of the SETS on the run queue
### Multi Level Feedback Queue
- Multiple Levels of RR queue
- Job starts are top
	- Use quantum: move down otherwise stay
- Periodically all jobs back to top similar to SRTF
- Parameters: number of queues, quantum length per queue, time to move jobs back up
### Gaming Scheduler
- Process can split app into multiple processes
- Periodally terminate and restart
- Yield CPU before quantum expires
- Detecting this requires scheduler maintains more state -> more overhead for scheduler
### Multi-Core Scheduling
- Balance Load
	- Each job should get about the same amount of CPU
- Scheduling Affinity
	- Avoid moving processes between cores to avoid wasting cache content
- Avoid access contention of run queue
	- Locking of run queue data structure to avoid for scalability

### Thread Scheduling
- Share code and data segments
- ignore this
- Gang scheduling
	- All threads of a process run together
	- Good for CPU parallelism
- Space based affinity
	- Assign tasks to processors
	- Improve cache hit ratio
	- Good for I/O parallelism
