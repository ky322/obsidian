### Shell
- Interpreter
- Language allows user to create and manage programs
- Reads line of input and executes them
- Has state: environment variables, home directory, working directory, list of processes
- Commands modify state
### Environment Variables
- Each process has access to collection of ev
	- Implicit argument to process
- Each env variable has name and value (strings)
- One env variable is the search "path"
### Shell Commands
- `echo [args]`: prints arguments
- `ls`: List working directory
- `pwd`: print working directory
- `cd [dir`; change working directory
- `ps`: list running processes
#### Flags
- Options
- Arguments to command that start with `-`
- `ls-l`: long listing
- `ps -a`: print all processes
#### Foreground vs Background
- Shell is reading from standard input or waiting for process to finish
	- foreground process
	- Other process are background process
- Add `&` to start background process
### Pipelines
- `x|y`
	- Runs x and y in foreground
	- output of x is input to y
	- finishes when both x and y finish
### Threads
- Place concurrent computation in same address space
- Process is an abstraction of a computer
	- CPU, memory devices
- Thread is an abstraction of a core
	- Registers
- Different processes have their own virtual memory but different threads share virtual memory
- Different processes tend to be mutually distrusting but threads are mutually trusting
- Threads are called processes or processors
- Thread stacks are allocated on heap

- Concurrency: Exploiting multiple CPUs and cores
- Mask long latency of I/O: Useful work while waiting
- Responsiveness: High priority GUI threads/ low priority work threads
- Encourages natural program structure: Express logically concurrent tasks
	- Update screen, fetching data, receive user input
### Preemption
- Two kinds of threads
	- Non-preemptive: explicitly yield to other threads
	- Preemptive: yield auto upon clock interrupts 
		- Most modern threading systems
### Thread Implementation
- One abstraction two implementations
- Kernel threads: Each thread has its own PCB in kernel but PCBs point to the same physical memory
	- Knows about schedule threads
	- Separate PCB for each thread
	- PCBs have same page table base registers
		- Different PC SP registers interrupt stacks
- User thread: One PCB for process; threads implemented entirely in user space
	- Each thread has its own thread control block and context
	- Mini OS in user space
		- Real OS unaware of threads
		- Single PCB
		- TCB for each thread
	- More Efficient than kernel level threads
### Kernel vs User level Threads
- Kernel
	- Easy to implement; processes with shared page table
	- Threads can run blocking system calls concurrently
	- But: thread switch requires three context switches
- User
	- User level context switches, scheduler
	- Blocking system call blocks all threads; need OS support for non blocking system calls
	- But at least: Thread switch efficiently implemented in user space
- Do not Assume schedule: Synchronization matters
