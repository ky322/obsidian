### Process vs Program
- Program: Code and data
- Stored in file on disk
- Running a program = creating a process
- Run a program multiple times sequentially or concurrently
- Program is passive: code and data
- Process is alive: mutable data + register + files
- Same program can be run multiple time simultaneously (1 program 2 processes)
### Executable
- File containing executable code (CPU instructions) and data (information manipulated by these instructions)
- Obtained by compiling a program and linking with libraries
### Process
- Executable running on an abstraction of a computer
- Address space (memory) + execution context (registers PC and SP)
	- Manipulated through machine instructions
- Environment 
	- Manipulated through system calls
#### Good Abstraction
- Portable and hides implantation details
- Intuitive and easy to use interface
- Instantiated many times
- Efficient to implement

### Process Memory
- Stack: call Stack
- Heap: used for memory allocation 
- Data: contains global variables
- Text: Read only text segment contains code and constants

### Environment
- CPU, registers, memory allow you to implement algorithms
### System Calls
- Process runs on CPU
- Can access OS kernel through system calls
#### Skinny Interface
- Portability: easy to implement and maintain
- Security: Small attack surface; easier to protect against vulnerabilities
### Executing System Call
- Process
	1. Calls system call function in library
	2. Places arguments in registers and or pushes
	3. Places `syscall` type in dedicated register
	4. Execute `syscall` machine instruction
- Kernel
	5. Execute syscall interrupt handler
	6. Places result in dedicated register
	7. Executes `return_from_interrupt`
- Process
	8. Executes `return_from_interrupt`
### Read Needs to Block
- reading from terminal
- Reading from disk and block not in cache
- Reading from remote file server
### Run Multiple Processes
- A process physically runs on CPU
- Each processes has its own registers, memory, I/O resources, thread of control
- More processes than the CPU has cores
	- Needs multiplex, schedule to create virtual CPUs for each process
### Process Control Block (PCB)
- For each process the OS has a PCB containing
	- Location in memory (page table)
	- Location of executable on disk
	- User executing process
	- Process Id
	- Process status
	- Scheduling information
	- interrupt stack
	- saved user SP: points into user stack
	- Saved kernel SP: points into interrupt stack, contains saved registers and kernel call stacks for this process
### Process Creation
- Init:
	- PCB Status: being created
	- registers: uninitialized
- Runnable:
	- PCB Status: on run Queue
	- registers: Pushed by kernel code onto interrupt stack
- Running:
	- PCB Status: Executing
	- registers: Popped from interrupt stack into CPU
- Runnable:
	- PCB Status: on run Queue
	- registers: Pushed onto interrupt stack (SP saved in PCB)
- Running:
	- PCB Status: Executing
	- registers: SP restored from PCB, other restored from stack
- Waiting:
	- PCB Status: Specific waiting queue
	- registers: on interrupt stack
- Runnable:
	- PCB Status: Run queue
	- registers: Interrupt stack
- Running:
	- PCB Status: Executing
	- registers: Restored from interrupt stack into CPU
- Finished:
	- PCB Status: deleted
	- registers: Not needed
### Invariants
- At most 1 process is RUNNING at any time
- When CPU is in user mode current process is RUNNING and interrupt stack is empty
- If RUNNING PCB is not on any queue
- If RUNNABLE or WAITING interrupt stack is non-empty and can be switched to
	- PCB is either on run queue or wait queue
- If FINISHED PCB is on finished queue
### Clean up
- Process cannot clean itself up
- Process can be cleaned by other process
	- Check for zombies before returning to RUNNING
- In Linux
	- Parent cleans up child process when waiting
	- If parent dies before child child process inherited by initial process which is waiting
### How to Yield or Wait
- Switching from executing current process to another runnable process
	- Process 1: Running to runnable/waiting
	- Process 2: Runnable to running
1. Save kernel registers of process 1 on its interrupt stack
2. Save kernel SP of process 1 in PCB
3. Restore kernel SP of process 2 from PCB
4. Restore kernel registers from its interrupt stack
### Context Switches
- Interrupt: From user to kernel space
	- System call, interrupt, exception
	- Px User stack to Px interrupt stack
- Yield: In kernel space between two processes
	- Happens inside kernel switching from one PCB interrupt stack to another
	- Px interrupt stack to Py interrupt stack
- Return from Interrupt" kernel space to user space
	- Through return from interrupt instruction
	- Py interrupt stack to Px user stack
- Context: CPU state which is captured in registers
- Context Switching: CPU can play different roles at different times

### Abstraction
- Manage complexity through abstraction 
- Kernel memory: memory used for kernel but memory used for processes
- Registers of a CPU are time multiplexed
- Kernel SP is just SP used by kernel
- A process is an abstraction
- Abstract computer with abstract memory, registers peripherals
- Hardware computer can be multiplexed to run multiple processes
	- Time multiplexed: Registers
	- Space multiplexed: disk
### Review
- Process: Abstraction of computer
- Context: Capture state of processor
	- Registers (PC and SP)
- Implementation uses Two contexts: user and kernel context
- PCB: Kernel data structure that saves contexts and other information on process
### Kernel Actions to Create Process
- `fork()`
	- Allocate ProcessID
	- Create and initialize PCB
	- Create and initialize new address space
	- Inform scheduler new process is ready to run
- `exec(program, arguments)`
	- Load program into address space
	- Copy arguments into memory in address space
	- Initialize h/w context to start execution at "start"
