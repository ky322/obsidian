### Support for Processes
- OS Kernel: Manage and isolate multiple processes
	- Kernel runs in supervisor mode/kernel mode
		- Unrestricted access to all hardware
	- Processes run in user mode
		- Restricted access to memory, devices, certain machines instruction
		- Other instructions run directly on CPU
			- No performance penalty
	- Kernel maintains process control block (PCB) for each process
		- Holds page table and stuff
#### Kernel Gets Control
- Boot (reset, power cycle)
	- Kernel initializes devices
- Signals
	- User mode to supervisor mode
- There is no main loop
#### Types of Signals
- Exceptions (Faults)
	- Synchronous/ Non maskable
	- process missteps (divide by zero)
	- Privileged instructions
- System calls
	- Synchronous / non maskable
	- User program request OS service
- Device or I/O interrupts
	- Asynchronous / maskable
	- HW device requires OS service
		- Timer I/O device, inter-processor
- Interrupt = signal
#### H/W Interrupt Management
![[Pasted image 20240227043002.png]]
- CPU has only one device interrupt input
- Interrupt Controller manages interrupts from multiple devices
	- Interrupts have descriptors of interrupting device
	- Priority selector circuit examines all interrupting devices, reports highest priority level to CPU
#### Interrupt Handling
1. Handle interrupt and remove cause
2. Restore what was running before interrupt
	- State may have been modified on purpose
- Two actors in handling interrupt
	- Hardware goes first
	- Kernel code takes control in interrupt handler
- On signal hardware
	1. Saves certain state that is modified by interrupt
		- Program counter and mode
	2. Disables (masks) device interrupts
	3. Sets supervisor mode
	4. Sets PC to signal handler
		- interrupt vector initialized during boot
		- I/O interrupt handler, system call handler, page fault handler
- Return from interrupt instruction
	- Restores mode
	- Restores program counter and instruction pointer
	- Re-enables interrupts
- User process has a stack to maintain control flow
- Kernel has its own control flow and needs a stack
#### Separating User Stack and Supervisor Stack
- User SP may be illegal
	- Badly aligned or pointing to unwriteable memory
- May not be large enough and cause data to be overwritten
	- Stack grows down heap grows up
- User may SP for things other than stack
- Security risks if only one stack
	- Kernel could push data on user stack and leave it there (pop does not erase memory)
	- Process could corrupt kernel code or data by pointing SP to kernel address
#### Two Architectures of OS Kernels
![[Pasted image 20240227044221.png]]
- Process
	- Kernel has one interrupt stack
	- Each process has a user stack
	- Kernel implemented using event based programming
		- Programmer saves and restores process state explicitly
	- Kernel has to translate between virtual and physical addresses when accessing user memory
- Library
	- Each process has a user stack and an interrupt stack (part of PCB)
	- Kernel implemented using thread based programming
		- Handled by language run time through blocking
	- Kernel can access user memory directly (through page table)
### Summary
- Kernel is code that runs in supervisor mode
- Process is code that runs in user mode
- Each has its own segments (code, data, heap, stack) and registers (pc, sp, r1, r2)
	- Both are virtual (CPU does not know)
- Switching between modes
	- User to supervisor: signal: interrupt, system call, exception/fault
	- Supervisor to user: return from interrupt instruction
- Interrupt Handling Software
	- Interrupt handler pushes registers onto interrupt stack of the running process (PCB)
	- On interrupt kernel needs to save the process registers as kernel code needs to user registers to handle interrupt
	- Registers are saved on the interrupt stack but stored anywhere in PCB
	- Saving and restoring registers is expensive; not all registers need to be saved as kernel uses a subset and most functions already save and restores registers they use
```
HandleInterruptX:
	PUSH Rn
	PUSH R1 // Only save registers not saved by C functions
	Call __handleX // Call C function handleX()
	POP R1
	POP Rn // Restore registers saved
	RETURN_FROM_INTERRUPT
```
#### Signal Handling View from Process
- Device interrupts
	- Invisible to running process; Process is restored to prior state including program counter
	- Certain interrupts may be passed on to process
- System calls
	- process is modified
		- Dedicated register contains result of system call
		- Memory may have been modified
- exception
	- Process is terminated
	- process can set up handler if desired
### How Kernel Starts New Process
- Allocate and initialize a PCB
- Set up initial page table
- Push process argument onto user stack
- Simulate an interrupt
	- Save program counter, interrupts enabled bit, supervisor mode bit (user mode)
- Clear all other registers
- Return from interrupt
### Support for Devices
- OS kernel manage and multiplex devices
- Device presents itself to the CPU as memory
- Example: Each pixel on the screen is a word in memory that can be written
- Devices define a range of device registers
	- Accessible through LOAD and STORE operations
#### Disk Device
- Can only read and write blocks not words
- Registers
	1. Block number: Which block to read or write
	2. Memory address: Where to copy block from and to
	3. Command register: start read and write operations
		- Device interrupts CPU upon completion
	4. Interrupt stack register: tell device interrupt received
	5. Status register: examine status of operations
#### Network Devices
- Registers
	1. Receive memory addresses for incoming packets
	2. Send memory address for outgoing packets
	3. Command register: send and receive packet
		- Device interrupts CPU upon completion
	4. Interrupt stack register tell device interrupt received
	5. Status register: to examine status of operations
#### Device Drivers
- Code module that deals with a brand of hardware device
	- Initialization, starting operations, interrupt handling, error handling
- OS has many disk drivers, network drivers
- Disk drivers and network drivers have common API
	- disk_init(), read_block(), write_block()
- Kernel provide many functions for drivers
	- Interrupt management, memory allocation, queues, copying between user space and kernel space, error logging
### Booting an OS
1. CPU starts at fixed address
	- Supervisor mode and interrupts disabled
2. BIOS in ROM loads boot loader code from specified storage or network device into memory and runs it
3. Boot loader loads OS kernel code into memory and runs it
#### OS Initialization
1. Determine location and size of physical memory
2. Set up initial MMU and page tables
3. Initialize interrupt vector
4. Determine which devices computer has and invokes device driver initialization code for each
5. Initialize file system code
6. Load first process from file system
7. Start first process
