### OS is a Concurrent Program
- The kernel contexts of each of the processes share many data structures
- Sharing is complicated by interrupt handlers that access those data structures
- Concurrent programs are non deterministic
	- Run twice with same input get two different answers
	- One time works other time fails
- Program statements are executed non-atomically
	- 2 threads updating a shared variable amount
### Race Conditions
- Timing dependent error involving shared state
- Once thread A starts it needs to race to finish
- Whether race condition happen depend on thread schedule
	- Different possible schedules
	- All possible interleaving should be safe
- Hard to debug
	- Number of possible interleaving huge
	- Some good and bad interleaving
	- Timing dependent: small changes hide bugs
		- Add print statement bug does not appear to happen
### Harmony
- Concurrent programming language
- New underlying virtual machine
- Model: checking Tries all possible execution of program until problem
- Code, values of shared variables, states of each running thread
#### I/O
- Input: 
- `choose, x=choose({1,2,3})`: - Know all possible inputs
- `const: const x = 3`
- Output:
	- `print: print x+y`
	- `assert x + y < 10, (x,y)`
#### Non Determinism
- Three sources
	1. Choose expressions
	2. Thread interleaving
	3. Interrupts
- Models must be finite but can have cycles, unbounded
	- Checks for possibility of termination
### Serialize
- Must be serialized due to shared memory access
- Goals
	- Mutual exclusion: 1 thread in critical section at time
	- Progress: Thread can get in when no other thread
		- Need both; trivial to achieve by itself
	- Fairness: Equal chances of getting into CS (not needed in practice)
- Show Peterson's for any execution all states reached satisfy mutual exclusion
- invariant: property that holds in all reachable states
- Property: Set of States

### Prove Invariant
- Need to show for any execution all states reached satisfy the invariant
### Concurrent Writing
- Programming languages leave out outcome of concurrent operations to a variable undefined
### Data Race
- When two threads access same variable and at least one is a STORE semantics of outcome is undefined
### Harmony
- Sequential Consistency: `sequential turn, flags` ensures loads/stores are atomic (concurrent operations appear to be executed sequentially)
- Example: Shared variable x contains 3
	- Thread A stores 4 into x
	- Thread B loads x
	- B reads 3 or 4 with atomic load and store operations but normal B reads undefined
- Loading and Storing Sequential consistent (volatile) variables is more expensive than loading and storing ordinary variables
	- Restricts CPU and or compiler optimizations
### Peterson's
- Mutual exclusion can be implemented with atomic LOAD and STORE instructions to access shared memory
	- Hardware supports such instructions but are very expensive
- Petersons can be generalized to > processes more LOAD and STOREs but too inefficient in practice
### Interlock Instruction
- Machine instructions that do multiple shared memory accesses atomically
- Entire operation is atomic other machine instructions cannot interleave 
- `TestAndSet s`
	- Set s to True
	- Return old value of s
	- LOAD r0, s
	- STORE s, 1 (Store TRUE in s)
### Pointers
- If x is shared variable ?x is address of x
- If p is shared variable and p contains ?x p is pointer to x
- !p refers to value of x

### Ghost State
 - Lock held or owned by a thread
	 - Implicit ghost state
- Two invariants
	- T@CriticalSection -> T holds lack
	- At most one thread can hold the lock
