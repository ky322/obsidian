### Spinlocks and Time Sharing
- Spinlocks work when thread on different cores need to synchronize
- When it involves 2 threads time sharing on same core
	- When no preemption
		- Can cause all threads to get stuck while one is trying to obtain spinlock
	- Pre-emption
		- Can cause delays and waste CPU cycles while thread is trying to obtain spinlock
### Context Switching in Harmony
- Allows contexts to be saved and restored
- `r= stop p`: Stops current thread and stores context in !p
- `go (!p) r`: Adds thread with given context to bag of threads. Thread resumes from stop expression returning r
- `synch`: module that has lock specification
	- Faster; smaller state graph
- `synchS`: stop and go version of lock

### Summary
- Data race: Two threads try to access same variable and at least one access is non-atomic and at least one access is an update
	- Outcome may be undefined and a bug
- Race condition: Correctness of program depends on ordering of variable access
	- Does not imply data race
- Critical Section: One or more regions of code in which at most thread can execute at a time
	- Protected by a lock 
	- Not the same as atomic because threads can continue to execute other regions
- Beware of code with multiple critical sections, uses multiple locks
