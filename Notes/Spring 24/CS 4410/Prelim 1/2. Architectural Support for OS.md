### Anatomy of a Computer
#### Bus
- Collection of lines (wires)
- Control Bus: Load/Store/Interrupt
- Data Bus: x lines
	- Word is x bits
	- 32 lines: word is 32 bits (4 bytes)
- Address bus: y lines
	- Address is y bits
	- Process can address at most $2^y$ bytes
#### CPU and Memory
- Memory is an array of bytes
- Address is an index into the array
- CPU stores in memory, Memory loads in CPU

#### Memory Segments
- Stack is word aligned
- Push and pops words

#### Stack - Push
- Word goes under Stack
- SP goes down 
- FFFF1234 -> FFFF1230
#### Stack - Pop
- SP goes up 
- FFFF1000
- FFFF1004
### Control Flow the Stack
- call f:
	- Saves the return address
	- Set program counter to address of f
	- f will start with saving registers that it wants to use and ends with restoring them
- return 
	- restore return address
### Return Address
 - x86: return address pushed onto stack
	 - Allows for nested calls automatically
- RISC-V, ARM
	- Saved in special register
	- Caller is responsible for saving and restoring the register if needed
### Arguments and Return Values
- Arguments are passed in registers
- If too many arguments rest is passed by pushing onto stack
- Return value is stored in a dedicated register
