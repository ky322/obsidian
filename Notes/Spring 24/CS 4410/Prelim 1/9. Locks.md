- Each Data structure maintains some consistency property
	- Assume property holds right after obtaining lock
	- Must make sure property holds before releasing lock
- Invariant: Lock not held -> Data structure consistent
	- Data structure inconsistent -> lock held
### Concurrent Queue
`q = queue.Queue()`
`queue.put(q,v) #add v to tail of q`
`v=queue.get(q) # return None if q is empty or v if v was head of queue`

- Any resource that needs scheduling
- Inter process communication

### Global vs Local Lock
- Global lock is easy but limits concurrency
- Fine grained or local locking can improve concurrency but tricky

### Systematic Testing
- Sequential case: Try all sequences of 1 operation then two...
	- Correctness: compare behavior of running test against implementation with running test against the sequential specification
- Concurrent case: Try interleaving of 1 operation then two...
	- Correctness: compare behaviors of running test against concurrent implementation with running test against concurrent specification
