### What an OS Does
- OS is an intermediary between programs and hardware
- OS creates an environment to execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner
	- Allocates resources (CPU, storage)
	- Controls programs
		- Cooperation (sharing and synchronization)
		- Isolation (protection and resource management)
### Ways to View an OS
- Services it provides to programs
- Components implementing those services
	- Internal design and implementation
	- Real hardware is hard to use directly
### Systems vs Programs
- Designing an OS differs from designing a program
	- Measure of success: Extensibility, security, reliability
	- External interface: More complicated and subject to change I/O devices
	- Structuring techniques: Employs modules, layers, client serer, event handler, transaction
- OS must bridge mismatched performance characteristics
	- Registers vs RAM vs disk
	- Phone vs laptop vs server
### What Makes a system Complex
- Emergent properties: Evident only when components are combined
- Propagation of effects: Small changes have disproportionate effects
- Incommensurate scaling: different parts have different scaling rules
### Managing Complexity
- Modularity: Good modularity minimizes connections between components
- Abstraction: Separate interface from internals; separate specification from implementation
- Hierarchy: constrains interactions so easier to understand
- OS Roles
	- Referee: Manages shared resources
		- Multiple concurrent tasks, who gets how much
		- Isolation: Faulty app should not disrupt other apps
			- Must expect less than full power of underlying hardware
		- Communication: Apps need to share state
	- Illusionist: Infinite memory
		- Virtualization: Resources seem present but are not
		- Abstraction: Enables new assumptions for clients
			- Atomic operations
			- Reliable communication channels
	- Glue: Offers set of common services, separates apps from I/O devices
		- Simplify app design and facilitate sharing
			- Send and receive byte streams
			- read and write files
			- pass messages
			- share memory
			- UI
### Issues in OS Design
- Structure, concurrency, sharing, naming, protection, security, performance, reliability, portability, extensibility, communication, scale, persistence, accounting
