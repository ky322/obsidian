- Process running program
- Access kernel services through system calls
	- Enter supervisor mode
- Each process needs control of a CPU to run
- Time multiplex all processes that need a CPU
	- Virtualize CPU
- Save metadata in PCB
### Context Switches
- Saves context of current process: CPU state (registers using)
- To switch from P1 running to P2 runnable
	1. Save P1 kernel register onto P1 kernel stack
	2. Save P1 kernel SP into P1 PCB
	3. Restore P2 kernel SP from P2 PCB
	4. Restore P2 kernel registers from P2 kernel stack
- Save P1 user register
- Save P1 kernel register
- Restore P2 kernel register 
- Restore P2 kernel register
### Threads
- Abstraction of CPU core
- Allows exeuction of concurrent tasks with easy communication
- Can be non-preemptive or preemptive
- Implemented in user space or kernel space
#### Kernel Level threads
- Implemented in kernel space
- One PCB per thread
- each thread shares the same base register but different contexts
	- Stack3, Stack 2, stack 1, heap, data, text
- Processes witih shared virtual memory
- Can run blocking system calls concurrently
- Need 3 context switches (user > kernel> user)
#### User Level Threads
- Implemented in user space
- One PCB for everything
- One TCB per thread
- Each stack lives in the heap of the parent process
- Need user level context switching scheduling
- Blocking system calls blocks all threads
- Needs 1 context switch (user)
### Shell
- user lveel command interpreter
- Exposes OS services to user
- Can use flags to modify commands
- `x & y`: Runs process x in the background and y in foreground
- `a | y`:  Runs x then y with x passing results into y
### Scheduling
- Mechanism: a functionality
- Policy: How functionality should be used
- job: task that needs a period of CPU time (process)
	- Arrival time: when job was submitted
	- Execution: Time needed to complete job
	- Deadline: when job must be completed
- Minimize response time and turnaround time
- Throughput: Rate at which job completes maximize
- Overhead: Work required to switch jobs: minimize
- Starvation: lack of progress made for a job minimize
- Fairness: how equal progress is towards job maximize
- Predictability: how variable jobs are scheduled
- Preemptive
	- Jobs can be forced to switch via timer interrupts
- Non-preemptive (cooperative)
	- Jobs must voluntarily give up CPU time
- FIFO: Schedule jobs by order in which they arrive
	- Simple, low overhead cost, no starvation
	- Average turnaround time is senstive to schedule order
	- Not responsive to interactive jobs
- Shortest Job First:
	- Schedule jobs in order of execution time
	- Optimal average turnaround time
	- Bad variance in turnaround time
	- Need to calculate estimates of job execution times
	- Can starve long jobs
- Earliest Deadline first
	- Meets all deadlines if possible
	- No starvation
	- Does not optimize other metrics
	- Jobs without deadlines
- Round Robin: Give each job a turn to execute fairly each given a quantum of time each burst <= quantum, after which the job is preempted. Priority to next job which has not run in the most time
	- Smallest quantum incur high overhead costs
	- Long quantum = FIFO
	- Can reduce response time
	- No starvation
	- High overhead cost (context switches)
	- Bad average turnaround times for jobs of equal length
