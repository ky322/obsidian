 Coulomb's Law: The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them $$F=k\dfrac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$
 The two forces obey Newton's Law; They are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, even when the charges are not equal in magnitude 

$\Large\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=k=8.9\times10^9\mathrm{\frac{N\cdot m^2}{C^2}}$ $e=1.6\times10^{-19}\mathrm{C}$

Coulomb's Law: $\Large F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$

$1\mathrm{\mu C}=10^{-6}\mathrm{C}$ $1\mathrm{nC}=10^{-9}C$

Principle of Superposition: When two charges exert forces simultaneously on a third charge, the total force acting on that charge is the vector sum of the forces that the two charges would exert individually

### Example 21.2 Forces Between Two Point charges
Two point charges $q_1=+25\mathrm{nC}$ and $q_2=-75\mathrm{nC}$ are separated by a distance $r=3.0\mathrm{cm}$. Find the magnitude and the direction of the electric force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$ and that $q_2$ exerts on $q_1$

$$\begin{align}
F_{1\space\text{on}\space 2}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}\\&=(9.0\times10^9\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{|(25\times 10^{-9}\mathrm{C})(-75\times10^{-9}\mathrm{C})|}{(0.030\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=0.019\space\mathrm{N}
\end{align}$$

The charges have opposite signs so the force is attractive. 
Evaluate: Even though the charges have different magnitudes the magnitude of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$ is the same as the magnitude that $q_2$ exerts on $q_1$
Key Concept: The electric forces that two point charges exert on each other obey Newton's third law. The force that the first charge exerts on the second charge has the same magnitude as the force that the second charge exerts on the first charge but points in the opposite direction. The forces are repulsive if the two charges have the same sign and attractive otherwise.

### Example 21.3 Vector Addition of Electric Forces On A Line 
Two point charges are located on the x-axis of a coordinate system: $q_1=1.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ is at $x=+2.0\space\mathrm{cm}$ and $q_2=-3.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ at $x=+4.0\space\mathrm{cm}$. What is the total electric force exerted by $q_1$ and $q_2$ on a charge $q_3=5.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ at $x=0$?
$$\begin{align}
F_{1\space\text{on}\space 3}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_3|}{r^2_{13}}\\&=(9.0\times10^9\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{|(1.0\times 10^{-9}\mathrm{C})(5.0\times10^{-9}\mathrm{C})|}{(0.020\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=1.12\times10^{-4}\space\mathrm{N}=112\space\mathrm{\mu N}
\end{align}$$
$F_{2\space\text{on}\space3}=84\space\mathrm{\mu N}$ so $\vec{F}_{1\space\text{on}\space3}=(-112\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}$ and $\vec{F}_{2\space\text{on}\space3}=(84\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}$
$\vec{F}=(-112\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}+(84\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}=-28\space\mathrm{\mu N}\hat{i}$

### Example 21.4 Vector Addition of Electric Forces In A Plane 
Two equal positive charges $q_1=q_2=2.0\space\mathrm{\mu C}$ are located at $x=0,\space y=0.30\space\mathrm{m}$ and $x=0,\space y=-0.30\space\mathrm{m}$. What are the magnitude and direction of the total electric force that $q_1$ and $q_2$ exert on a third charge $Q=4.0\space\mathrm{\mu C}$ at $x=0.4\space\mathrm{m},\space y=0$?

$$\begin{align}
F_{1\space\text{or}\space2\space\text{on}\space Q}&=(9.0\times10^9\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{(4.0\times 10^{-6}\space\mathrm{C})(2.0\times10^{-6}\space\mathrm{C})}{(0.50\space\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=0.29\space\mathrm{N}
\end{align}$$
The x-components of the two forces are equal: $$(F_{1\space\text{or}\space2\space\text{on}\space Q})x=(F_{1\space\text{or}\space2\space\text{on}\space Q})\cos\alpha=0.29\space\mathrm{N}\frac{0.40\space\mathrm{m}}{0.50\space\mathrm{m}}=0.23\space\mathrm{N}$$
From symmetry the y-components of the two forces are equal and opposite so the sum is zero and the total force $\vec{F}$ on $Q$ is $F_x=0.23\space\mathrm{N}+0.23\space\mathrm{N}=0.46\space\mathrm{N}$
