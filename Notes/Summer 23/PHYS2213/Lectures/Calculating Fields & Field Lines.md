Electric Field Line: An imaginary line drawn through a region of space so that its tangent at any point is in the direction of the electric field vector at that point.
Field lines never intersect
Electric field lines show the direction of $\vec{E}$ at each point and their spacing gives a general idea of the magnitude of $\vec{E}$ at that point. 
- Where $\vec{E}$ is strong lines are drawn close together; lines are farther apart when weak 
In general, the magnitude of the electric field is different at different points on a given field line; a field line is not a curve of constant electric field magnitude
In a uniform field, the field lines are straight, parallel and uniformly spaced 

## Electric Dipoles 
Electric Dipole: Pair of point charges with equal magnitude and opposite direction separated by a distance $d$

An electric dipole in a uniform external electric field $\vec{E}$ have a net force of zero. However, the two forces do not act along the same line so the torques do not sum to zero. 
$$\tau=(qE)(d\sin\phi)$$
Electric dipole moment; $p=qd$
The magnitude of torque on an electric dipole: $\tau=pE\sin\phi$
Vector torque of on an electric dipole: $\vec{\tau}=\vec{p}\times\vec{E}$
Potential Energy for an electric dipole in an electric field: $U=-\vec{p}\cdot\vec{E}$
