- $L=\mu n NA$
- $\epsilon(t)=-L\frac{di(t)}{dt}$
- $\Phi(t)=Li(t)$
- If I is constant inductor act like wire
- $V_L(t)=L\frac{dI(t)}{dt}$
- $\tau = L/R$
- When I changes, an induced voltage drop vL appears across the inductor's terminals to  oppose that change in the external circuit (Faraday’s & Lenz ’ Laws)
