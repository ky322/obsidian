- $\Phi_B=\int\int \vec{B}\vec{dA}=\int\int BdA_\perp=\int\int B_\perp dA$
- EMF = $\epsilon = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$
	- Voltage
- Induce EMF by
	- Changing magnetic field 
	- Changing the area of the loop  
	- Rotating the loop
- Induced electric current in a wire loop of N identical coils connected in series
	- $\epsilon = -N\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}, I=\frac \epsilon R$
	- $\Phi_B$ magnetic flux thru one coil of loop
	- R = Loops total resistance
- Lenz Law: The direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to  
oppose the change that produced the effect110
