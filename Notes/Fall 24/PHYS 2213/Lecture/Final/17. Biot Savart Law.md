- Magnetic Moment: $\mu = NI\vec{A}$ 
- $\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}$
- Hall Effect: Two conductors in uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$ directed into the page carry current to the right
	- Finding the force on the charges in the magnetic field  
	- Determining where the charges move to as a result of the force  
	- Finding the resulting electric field, current density, and voltage
- Moving point charges create magnetic fields
- $$\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{q\vec{v}\times\vec{r}}{r^3}$$
- Biot Savart: $$\vec{dB}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I\vec{dL}\times\vec{r}}{r^3}$$
- Point thumb in direction of current and curl in direction of $\vec{B}$
