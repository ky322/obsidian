- When a capacitor is not yet charged it acts like a wire
	- No voltage drop yet $V=\frac Q V, Q = 0$
- When a capacitor is fully charged/discharged it acts like a broken wire
	- Done charging no current Charge is not charging $\frac{dQ}{dt}=0$
- Ask 
	- Is the capacitor charging or discharging
	- Does the capacitor start charged
	- What will the final state of the capacitor be?
- Charge a Capacitor
	- $\epsilon - IR - \frac Q C = 0$
	- $\tau=RC, Q_f=C\epsilon$
