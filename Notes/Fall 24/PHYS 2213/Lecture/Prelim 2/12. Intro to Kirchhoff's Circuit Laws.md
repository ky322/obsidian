- $\vec{J}= \sigma\vec{E}=\frac 1 \rho\vec{E}$
	- $\sigma$ conductivity
	- $\rho$ resistivity
	- Ohmic if $\sigma,\rho$ constant
- $R=\frac V I$
- For an unchanging cross section $R=\frac{\rho L}A$
- Ammeter: Measures current and has zero resistance
- Voltmeter measures voltage and has infinite resistance (no current)
- $\varepsilon$: Work per unit charge energy source for a circuit
- Ideal battery has terminal voltage $V=\varepsilon$
- Real batteries have internal resistance $V=\varepsilon\pm IR$
- Current can go either way through a battery
	- If negative to positive then emf supplies energy to the circuit
	- If positive to negative then battery is being charged
- When battery is connected into an open circuit charge from battery terminals spread over the conductor surfaces for electrostatic equilibrium 
- When switch is closed equilibrium is no longer possible because battery keeps pumping charge into circuit
- Kirchhoff's Voltage Law
	- $\sum\Delta V_i =0$ around a closed loop
	- $\sum_{a\rightarrow b}\Delta V$ is same along path from a to b
		- $\oint \vec{E}\vec{dl}=0$
	- Conservation of Energy V cannot depend on path taken
- Current Law
	- $\sum I_i =\sum I_o$
	- Conversation of Charge No charge buildup at junctions
	- $I_1 = I_2 + I_3$
	- $I_1-I_2-I_3=0$
