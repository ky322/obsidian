- In a parallel plate capacitor
	- If the battery remains connected the voltage stays the same
	- If the capacitor is not connected Q stays the same
- Electric Current: $I=\frac{dQ}{dt}$
	- Units A = $\frac C s$
	- Moving right give the same c
	- Direction of electric current is direction of movement of positive charges
	- Current due to negative charges is in the direction opposite to the movement of negative charges
- Electric field drives electric current in a conductor
- In a vacuums mobile q would accelerate continually
- In a conductor mobile q experience effective drag forces when moving so an electric field is need to keep them moving
	- $F=qE$ gives the q an average drift velocity $v_d$ that is parallel to $F_e$ and $\propto E$ 
- Average drift velocity of mobile charges is responsible for electric current
- Electric current is a non-equilibrium situation
- $I=\frac{nA_\perp l q}{l/\ v_d}=nqv_dA_\perp$
- Current Density: $J = \frac I A = nqv_d$
	- $\vec{J}=nq\vec{v_d}$
- Current is the flux of the current density through the cross section
	- $I=\int\vec{J}d\vec{A}$
	- $\vec{J}=\sum n_iq_i\vec{v}_{d,i}$
	- n = number density of mobile charges
	- q = charge of mobile charge
	- v = drift velocity
- $\vec{J}=\sigma\vec{E}=\frac 1 p \vec{E}$
	- E = electric field
	- $\sigma$ = conductivity
	- $\rho$ resistivity
- $\vec{E}=0$ inside a perfect conductor
- $V$ is the same and is equipotential
