- Positive charges feel force towards lower potential
- $\vec{E}=0$ inside a conductor
	- Conductors are equipotentials
	- $\Delta V = 0$ across a conductor
- Capacitors store electric energy by accumulating charge
	- Can build up charge and dissipate charge
- Capacitor vs Battery
	- Store electrical energy in form of charge vs chemical energy
	- Charge and discharge Rate: fast vs slow
	- voltage output: depends on circuit and timing vs constant
- Parallel plate capacitor
- $C=\frac Q V$ where Q is charge on one plate and V is the potential difference between plates
- For parallel plates: $C=\frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$
	- $\Delta V = \frac{Qd}{\epsilon_0 A}$
	- $C=\frac{Q}{\frac{Qd}{\epsilon_0 A}}$
- Capacitance only depends on geometry
- How to Find Capacitance
	- Situation with two conductors separated by distance d
	- Pretend Q goes from one conductor to the other
		- $+Q, -Q$
	- Calculate the electric potential difference $\Delta V$
	- $C=\frac Q V$
	- Result should not depend on Q
	- $C=\frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$ for parallel plates
- Energy in Capacitor: $U=\frac 1 2 QV$
- $C=\frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}$
