- Electric potential Energy U
	- Two charges $q_1, q_2$ separated by R
	- We have to work to putting these two charges together 
- W = $-\int_a^b\vec{F_e}d\vec{l} = -\int_\infty^R\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}\hat{r}dr\hat{r} = \frac{kq_1q_2}{R}=U$
- $U(R) = \frac{kq_1q_2}{R}$
- Coulomb force is a conservative force
	- The work done is independent of path taken
	- The work is reversible $KE \leftrightarrow PE$
- $U(\infty) = 0$
- Work $W_{a\rightarrow b} = \int_a^b\vec{F}d\vec{l}$
- If force is conservative then we can define a potential energy $W_{a\rightarrow b}=U_a-U_b = -(U_b-U_a)=-\Delta U$
- $U=0$ as $R\rightarrow\infty$
- $W=-\Delta U, \Delta K = -\Delta U$
- An object wants to go to lower potential energy
- Electric Potential
	- $V_{a\rightarrow b}=-\int_a^b\vec{E}d\vec{l}$
	- $V_{ab}$ is the electric potential at point b relative to point a $V(b)-V(a)$
- Only changes in potential are significant
- Scalar
- $\vec{E}=-\Delta V=-(\frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\hat{i}+\frac{\partial V}{\partial y}\hat{j}+ \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}\hat{k})$
- $\Delta V = \frac {\Delta U} q$
