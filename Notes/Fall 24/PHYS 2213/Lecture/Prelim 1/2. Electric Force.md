- Coulomb's Law $F_e=\frac{kq_1q_2}{r^2}$
- Charges must be small in size compared to r or have spherical symmetry
- Charges must be at rest or moving slowly compared to the speed of light c
- Position vector of an object always goes from origin to object
- Principle of Superposition: The net electric force acting on any electric charge q is the vector sum of the individual electric forces acting on q due to all other electric charges everywhere
