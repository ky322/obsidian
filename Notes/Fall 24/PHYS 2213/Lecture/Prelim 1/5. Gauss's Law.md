- Flux: Flow of something through a surface
- $\Phi = EA$
	- True if E is constant and perpendicular to the surface
- $\Phi_E = \vec{E}\vec{A} = EA_\perp = EA\cos\theta=E_\perp A$
- $|\vec{E}| \propto \frac{\text{Number of field lines through an area}}{A_{\perp}}$
- Total Electric Flux $\Phi_E = \int\vec{E}d\vec{A}=\int EdA_\perp=\int E_\perp dA$
### Electric Flux Through a Surface
- Normal vectors always point outwards
- Determines area vectors for closed surfaces
- Electric flux through a closed surface = 0 
### Gauss's Law
- Total electric flux through any **closed surface** is proportional to the total charged enclosed
$$\Phi_E=\unicode{x222F}\vec{E}d\vec{A}=\frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}$$
- Gaussian Surface: Closed Surface used to calculate flux
- $\vec{E}$ is the total electric field due to all electric charge not just the Q enclosed
- Integral is over the entire closed surface
- Electric flux $\propto$ number of field lines
- Applications
	- Determine electric filed for electric charge distributions with symmetry
	- Locate electric charge knowing electric fields
- Calculating Electric field lines
	1. Choose a good Gaussian surface
	2. Symmetry Check
		- Is $\vec{E} \perp || \parallel$
		- Is $|\vec{E}|$ constant across surface
	3. Use Gauss's Law
		- Calculate flux on left side and then right side
	4. Solve for E
