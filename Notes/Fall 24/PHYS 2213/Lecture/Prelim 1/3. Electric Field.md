- An atom can be polarized when electric charge is nearby resulting in attractive net electric force
- One charge modifies space around it independent of the second charge
	- Field can be used to calculate forces on any charges in space
- $\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}$ N/C
- $E=\frac{kQ}{r^2}$
- Electric Field Line Model
	- Electric field lines point in direction of net electric field at each point in space
	- Cannot cross
	- Start on positive charges and end on negative charges
	- Can extend to or from infinity
	- Number of field lines coming out a volume minus the number going into it is proportional to the number of charge in volume
	- $E\propto$ Number of field Lines/Area perpendicular to the lines
