- Choosing a surface where $\vec{E}$ is $\perp || \parallel$ for each face
- Conductor: Charges move freely
- Insulator: charges cannot move at all
- $\vec{E}=0$ inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium
	- Otherwise mobile charges q must feel a force and move which is not equilibrium 
- Any excess charge on a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium can be found on its surfaces (outer or inner)
	- If any isolated charges are present inside the conductor then $\vec{E}$ field lines must start and end on the charges and $\vec{E}\neq0$ inside
- Any $\vec{E}$ outside the surface of a conductor in electrostatic equibilibrum must be $\perp$ to the surface
	- $\vec{E}_\parallel\neq0$ then a mobile charge q would experience force and not be in equilibrium 
- A closed hollow cavity in a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has total charge = 0 in the cavity and on its inner surface. If the cavity is empty then there is no charge on its surface and E = 0 throughout the acvity
- The magnitude of the net electric field just outside the surface of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is related to the surface charge density there by $E=\frac \sigma \epsilon$
