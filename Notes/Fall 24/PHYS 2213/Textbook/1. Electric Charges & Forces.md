Two positive charges or two negative charges repel each other. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.

Atomic Number: The number of protons or electrons in a neutral atom of an element

Positive Ion: If one or more electrons are removed from an atom
Negative Ion: An atom that gained one or more electrons
Ionization: The gain or loss of electrons

Principle of Conservation of Charge: The algebraic sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is constant 

The magnitude of charge of the electron or proton is a natural unit of charge

Charging By Induction: The plastic rod can give another object a charge of opposite sign without losing any of its own charge
