The work done by the electric field: $W_{a\rightarrow b}=Fd=q_0Ed$
Work is positive if the force is in the same direction as the net displacement of the test charge 

The force exerted on $q_0$ by the uniform electric field is conservative
The potential energy for the electric force $F_y=-q_0E$ is $U=q_0E_y$

When the test charge moves from height $y_a$ to height $y_b$ the work done on the charge by the field is $W_{a\rightarrow b}=-\Delta U=-(U_b-U_a)=q_oE(y_a-y_b)$

$U$ increases if the test charge $q_0$ moves in the direction opposite the electric force $\vec{F}=q_0\vec{E}$
$U$ decreases if the test charge $q_0$ moves in the same direction as the electric force $\vec{F}=q_0\vec{E}$

## Electric Potential Energy of Two Point Charges 
The work done on charge $q_0$ by the electric field of charge $q$ does not depend on the path taken but only on the distances $r_a$ and $r_b$
Electric Potential Energy of Two Point Charges: $$U={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}{qq_0\over r}$$
If $q$ and $q_0$ have the same sign the interaction is repulsive, work is positive and $U$ is positive 
If $q$ and $q_0$ have opposite signs the interaction is attractive, work is negative and $U$ is negative

Electric Potential Energy of point charge $q_0$ and the collection of charges $q_1,q_2,q_3$$$U={q_0\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Big({q_1\over r_1}+{q_2\over r_2}+\cdots\Big)={q_0\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Sigma_i{q_i\over r_i}$$
For every electric field due to a static charge distribution the force exerted by that field is conservative

Electric Potential Energy: The work done by the electric field on a charged particle moving in the field 

The Potential Energy Difference $U_a - U_b$: The work that must be done by an external force to move the particle slowly from $b$ to $a$ against the electric force.

### Example 23.2 A System of Point Charges 
Two point charges are at fixed positions on the x-axis $q_1=-e$ at $x=0$ and $q_2=e$ at $x=a$. Find the work that must be done by n external force to bring a third point charge $q_3=e$ from infinity to $x=2a$.
$$W=U={q_3\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Big({q_1\over r_{13}}+{q_2\over r_{23}}\Big)={e\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Big({-e\over 2a}+{e\over a}\Big)={e^2\over8\pi\epsilon_0a}$$
If we bring $q_3$ in from infinity along the x-axis it is attracted to $q_1$ but repelled more strongly by $q_2$ so we do positive work to push $q_3$ to the position at $x=2a$

Find the total potential energy of the system of the three charges
$$U={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Sigma{q_iq_j\over r_{ij}}={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Big({q_1q_2\over r_{12}}+{q_1q_3\over r_{13}}+{q_2q_3\over r_{23}}\Big)={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Big[{-ee\over a}+{-ee\over2a}+{ee\over a}\Big]={-e^2\over8\pi\epsilon_0a}$$
The system has lower potential energy that it would if the three charges were infinitely far part. An external force would have to do negative work to bring the three charges from infinity to assemble this entire arrangement and would have to do positive work to move the three charges back to infinity. 

## Electric Potential 
Potential: Potential energy per unit charge $$V={U\over q_0}\Rightarrow U=q_0V$$
$V_{ab}$: The potential of $a$ with respect to $b$ equals the work that must be done to move a unit charge slowly from $b$ to $a$ against the electric force. 

Electric Potential Due to a Point Charge: $$V={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}{q\over r}$$
If $q$ is positive the potential it produces is positive at all points.
If $q$ is negative it produces a potential that is negative everywhere 
$V=0$ at $r=\infty$
Potential is independent of the test charge $q_0$ 
Electric Potential Due to a Collection of Point Charges: $$V={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Sigma_i{q_i\over r_i}$$
Electric Potential Due to a Continuous Distribution of Charge: $$V= {1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\int{dq\over r}$$

Electric Potential Difference: $$V_a-V_b=\int_a^b\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}=\int_a^b E\cos\phi dl$$
Integral along path from $a$ to $b$ and where $dl$ is the displacement
Independent of path taken from $a$ to $b$


General Rule:
Moving with the direction of $\vec{E}$ means moving in the direction of decreasing $V$
Moving against the direction of $\vec{E}$ means moving in the direction of increasing $V$

Electron Volt ($\mathrm{eV}$): $1\space\mathrm{eV}=1.603\times10^{-19}\space\mathrm{J}$

### Example 23.3 Electric Force and Electric Potential 
A proton moves a distance $d=0.50\space\mathrm{m}$ in a straight line between points $a$ and $b$ in a linear accelerator. The electric field is uniform along this line, with magnitude $E = 1.5\times10^7\space\mathrm{V/m}=1.5\times10^7\space\mathrm{N/C}$ in the direction from $a$ to $b$. Determine the force on the proton
$$F=qE=(1.602\times10^{-19}\space\mathrm{C})(1.5\times10^7\space\mathrm{N/C})=2.4\times10^{-12}\space\mathrm{N}$$
Determine the work done on it by the field 
$$W_{a\rightarrow b}=Fd=(2.4\times10^{-12}\space\mathrm{N})(0.50\space\mathrm{m})=1.2\times10^{-12}\space\mathrm{J}$$
Determine the potential difference $$V_a - V_b={W_{a\rightarrow b}\over q}={1.2\times10^{-12}\space\mathrm{J}\over1.602\times10^{-19}\space\mathrm{C}}=7.5\times10^6\space\mathrm{J/C}=7.5\times10^6\space\mathrm{V}=7.5\space\mathrm{MV}$$
$$V_a-V_b=\int_a^b=E\cos\phi dl=\int_a^bEdl=E\int_a^bdl=Ed=(1.5\times10^7\space\mathrm{V/m})(0.50\space\mathrm{m})=7.5\times10^6\space\mathrm{V}$$
### Example 23.4 Potential Due to Two Point Charges 
An electric dipole consists of point charges $q_1=+12\space\mathrm{nC}$ and $q_2=-12\space\mathrm{nC}$ placed $10.0\space\mathrm{cm}$ apart. Compute the electric potentials at point $a$
$$\begin{align}
V_a&={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}\Sigma_i{q_i\over r_i}={1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}{q_1\over r_1}+{1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}{q_2\over r_2}\\&=(9.0\times10^9\space\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2}){12\times10^{-9}\space\mathrm{C}\over0.060\space\mathrm{m}}+(9.0\times10^9\space\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2}){-12\times10^{-9}\space\mathrm{C}\over0.040\space\mathrm{m}}\\&=-900\space\mathrm{V}\\V_b&=1930\space\mathrm{V}\\V_c&=0
\end{align}$$

### Example 23.5 Potential and Potential Energy 
Compute the potential energy associated with a $+4.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ point charge if it is placed at points $a,b,c$
$$\begin{align}
U_a&= qV_a=(4.0\times10^{-9}\space\mathrm{C})(-900\space\mathrm{J/C})=-3.6\times10^{-6}\space\mathrm{J}\\
U_b&=qV_b=(4.0\times10^{-9}\space\mathrm{C})(1930\space\mathrm{J/C})=-3.6\times10^{-6}\space\mathrm{J}\\
U_c&=qV_c=0
\end{align}$$
### Example 23.6 Finding Potential by Integration 
By integrating the electric field, find the potential at a distance $r$ from a point charge $q$
Let $d\vec{l}=\hat{dr}$
$$\begin{align}
V-0&=\\V&=\int_r^\infty=\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}\\
&=\int_r^\infty{1\over4\pi\epsilon_0}{q\over r^2}\hat{r}\cdot\hat{r}dr\\
&=\int_r^\infty{q\over4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}dr\\
&={q\over4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\vert_r^\infty\\
&=0-(-{q\over4\pi\epsilon_0r^2})={q\over4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}
\end{align}$$
### Omit Example 23.7 
When a particle of charge $q$ moves from a point of higher potential to a point of lower potential, its potential energy decreases if $q$ is positive; its potential energy increases if $q$ is 
negative.
