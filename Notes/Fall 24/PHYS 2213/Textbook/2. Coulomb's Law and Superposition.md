 Coulomb's Law: The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them $$F=k\dfrac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$$
 The two forces obey Newton's Law; They are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, even when the charges are not equal in magnitude 

$\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=k=8.9\times10^9\mathrm{\frac{N\cdot m^2}{C^2}}$ $e=1.6\times10^{-19}\mathrm{C}$

Coulomb's Law: $F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}$

$1\mathrm{\mu C}=10^{-6}\mathrm{C}$ $1\mathrm{nC}=10^{-9}C$

Principle of Superposition: When two charges exert forces simultaneously on a third charge, the total force acting on that charge is the vector sum of the forces that the two charges would exert individually

### Example 21.2 Forces Between Two Point charges
Two point charges $q_1=+25\mathrm{nC}$ and $q_2=-75\mathrm{nC}$ are separated by a distance $r=3.0\mathrm{cm}$. Find the magnitude and the direction of the electric force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$ and that $q_2$ exerts on $q_1$

$$\begin{align}
F_{1\space\text{on}\space 2}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}\\&=(9.0\times10^9\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{|(25\times 10^{-9}\mathrm{C})(-75\times10^{-9}\mathrm{C})|}{(0.030\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=0.019\space\mathrm{N}
\end{align}$$

The charges have opposite signs so the force is attractive. 
Evaluate: Even though the charges have different magnitudes the magnitude of the force that $q_1$ exerts on $q_2$ is the same as the magnitude that $q_2$ exerts on $q_1$
Key Concept: The electric forces that two point charges exert on each other obey Newton's third law. The force that the first charge exerts on the second charge has the same magnitude as the force that the second charge exerts on the first charge but points in the opposite direction. The forces are repulsive if the two charges have the same sign and attractive otherwise.

### Example 21.3 Vector Addition of Electric Forces On A Line 
Two point charges are located on the x-axis of a coordinate system: $q_1=1.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ is at $x=+2.0\space\mathrm{cm}$ and $q_2=-3.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ at $x=+4.0\space\mathrm{cm}$. What is the total electric force exerted by $q_1$ and $q_2$ on a charge $q_3=5.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ at $x=0$?
$$\begin{align}
F_{1\space\text{on}\space 3}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{|q_1q_3|}{r^2_{13}}\\&=(9.0\times10^9\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{|(1.0\times 10^{-9}\mathrm{C})(5.0\times10^{-9}\mathrm{C})|}{(0.020\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=1.12\times10^{-4}\space\mathrm{N}=112\space\mathrm{\mu N}
\end{align}$$
$F_{2\space\text{on}\space3}=84\space\mathrm{\mu N}$ so $\vec{F}_{1\space\text{on}\space3}=(-112\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}$ and $\vec{F}_{2\space\text{on}\space3}=(84\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}$
$\vec{F}=(-112\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}+(84\space\mathrm{\mu N})\hat{i}=-28\space\mathrm{\mu N}\hat{i}$

### Example 21.4 Vector Addition of Electric Forces In A Plane 
Two equal positive charges $q_1=q_2=2.0\space\mathrm{\mu C}$ are located at $x=0,\space y=0.30\space\mathrm{m}$ and $x=0,\space y=-0.30\space\mathrm{m}$. What are the magnitude and direction of the total electric force that $q_1$ and $q_2$ exert on a third charge $Q=4.0\space\mathrm{\mu C}$ at $x=0.4\space\mathrm{m},\space y=0$?

$$\begin{align}
F_{1\space\text{or}\space2\space\text{on}\space Q}&=(9.0\times10^9\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{(4.0\times 10^{-6}\space\mathrm{C})(2.0\times10^{-6}\space\mathrm{C})}{(0.50\space\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=0.29\space\mathrm{N}
\end{align}$$
The x-components of the two forces are equal: $$(F_{1\space\text{or}\space2\space\text{on}\space Q})x=(F_{1\space\text{or}\space2\space\text{on}\space Q})\cos\alpha=0.29\space\mathrm{N}\frac{0.40\space\mathrm{m}}{0.50\space\mathrm{m}}=0.23\space\mathrm{N}$$
From symmetry the y-components of the two forces are equal and opposite so the sum is zero and the total force $\vec{F}$ on $Q$ is $F_x=0.23\space\mathrm{N}+0.23\space\mathrm{N}=0.46\space\mathrm{N}$

- The electric force on a charged object is exerted by the electric field created by other charged objects
- The electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F_0}}{q_0}$
- $\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$
- The electric field at every point of a conductor is 0
- A given charge distribution acts as a source of electric field
- The electric field exerts a force on any charge in the field
	- Calculate field caused by a source charge distribution
	- Look at effect of field in terms of force and motion
The electric force on a charged object is exerted by the electric field created by other charged objects 

Test Charge: A small charged object to test whether there is an electric field at a particular point 

The electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point is the electric force $\vec{F}_0$ experienced by a test charge $q_0$ at the point divided by the charge $q_0$ $$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F_0}}{q_0}$$
The electric field $\vec{E}$ does not depend on the charge of the object on which the electric force is exerted. $$\hat{r}=\frac{\vec{r}}{r}$$
Electric Field due to a Point Charge: $$\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
The electric field of a point charge always points away from a positive charge (in the same direction as $\hat{r}$) but towards a negative charge (the direction opposite $\hat{r}$)

Vector Field: $\vec{E}$ can be an infinite set of vector quantities 

If the magnitude and the direction of the field has the same values everywhere throughout a region the field is uniform in this region.

If there is an electric field within a conductor the field exerts a force on every charge in the conductor giving the free charges a net motion
- In electrostatics the electric field at every point within the material of a conductor must be 0

In electric interactions:
1. A given charge distribution acts as a source of electric field
	- Calculate the field caused by a source charge distribution
2. The electric field exerts a force on any charge that is present in the field
	- Look at the effect of the field in terms of force and motion 

### Example 21.5 Electric-Field Magnitude for a Point Charge 
What is the magnitude of the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a field point $2.0\space\mathrm{m}$ from a point charge $q=4.0\space\mathrm{nC}$?
$$\begin{align}
\vec{E}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r} \\&=(9.0\times10^9\space\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{4.0\times10^{-9}\space\mathrm{C}}{(2.0\space\mathrm{m})^2}\\&=9.0\space\mathrm{N/C}
\end{align}$$
The result $E=0.0\space\mathrm{N/C}$ indicates that if we placed a $1.0\space\mathrm{C}$ charge at a point $2.0\space\mathrm{m}$ from $q$ it would experience a $9.0\space\mathrm{N}$ force. The force on a $2.0\space\mathrm{C}$ charge at that point would be $18\space\mathrm{N}$

The magnitude of the electric field that a point charge produces at a given point is proportional to the magnitude of the charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the point charge to the point where the field is measured. 

### Example 21.6 Electric-Field Vector for a Point Charge 
A point charge $q=-8.0\space\mathrm{nC}$ is located at the origin. Find the electric-field vector at the field point $x=1.2\space\mathrm{m},y=-1.6\space\mathrm{m}$

The distance from $S$ to $P$: $r=\sqrt{(1.2\space\mathrm{m})^2+(-1.6\space\mathrm{m})^2}=2.0\space\mathrm{m}$
$$\hat{r}=\frac{\vec{r}}{r}=\frac{x\hat{i}+y\hat{j}}{r}=\frac{(1.2\space\mathrm{m})\hat{i}+(1.6\space\mathrm{m})\hat{j}}{2.0\space\mathrm{m}}=0.60\hat{i}-0.80\hat{j}$$
$$\begin{align}
\vec{E}&=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r} \\&=(9.0\times10^9\space\mathrm{N\cdot m^2/C^2})\frac{-8.0\times10^{-9}\space\mathrm{C}}{(2.0\space\mathrm{m})^2}(0.60\hat{i}-0.80\hat{j})\\&=-11\space\mathrm{N/C}\hat{i}+14\space\mathrm{N/C}\hat{j}
\end{align}$$
