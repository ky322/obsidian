### Energy Storage in Capacitors and Electric Field energy
The electric potential energy stored in a charged capacitor equals the work needed to charge it.

The total work $W$ needed to increase the capacitor charge $q$ from zero to $Q$: $$W=\int_0^WdW={1\over C}\int_0^Qqdq={Q^2\over2C}$$
Potential Energy Stored in a Capacitor: $$U={Q^2\over2C}={1\over2}CV^2={1\over2}QV$$
