- Algebraic Data Types: Contain sum and product types
	- Sum type" Value of a variant is formed by one constructor
	- Product: Constructor can carry tuples or records whose values have sub value from each of their component types
- Syntax: `type t = C1 [of t1] | ... | Cn [of tn]`
### Recursive Variants
```
type intlist = Nil | Cons of int * intlist

let lst3 = Cons (3, Nil)  (* similar to 3 :: [] or [3] *)
let lst123 = Cons(1, Cons(2, lst3)) (* similar to [1; 2; 3] *)

let rec sum (l : intlist) : int =
  match l with
  | Nil -> 0
  | Cons (h, t) -> h + sum t

let rec length : intlist -> int = function
  | Nil -> 0
  | Cons (_, t) -> 1 + length t

let empty : intlist -> bool = function
  | Nil -> true
  | Cons _ -> false
```
### Parameterized Variants
```
type 'a mylist = Nil | Cons of 'a * 'a mylist

let lst3 = Cons (3, Nil)  (* similar to [3] *)
let lst_hi = Cons ("hi", Nil)  (* similar to ["hi"] *)

let rec length = function
  | Nil -> 0
  | Cons (_, t) -> 1 + length t

let empty = function
  | Nil -> true
  | Cons _ -> false
```
- Type Constructor like a function but maps types to types
- Parametric Polymorphism: Functions do not care what 'a is
### Polymorphic Variants
- Variants but
	- Do not have to declare their type or constructor before using them
	- No name for a polymorphic variant type
	- Constructors of a polymorphic variant starts with '
### Built in Variants
- List: `type 'a list = [] | ( :: ) of 'a * 'a list`
- option: `type 'a option = None | Some of 'a`
