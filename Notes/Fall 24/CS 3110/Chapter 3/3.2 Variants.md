- Data Type representing a value that is different possibilities 
	- Like enums
- Syntax: `type t = C1 | ... | Cn
- Dynamic Semantics: Value so no computation
- Static Semantics: If t is a type as type t then C:t
### Scope
- The type defined later wins
### Pattern Matching
- The pattern C matches the value C and produces no bindings
