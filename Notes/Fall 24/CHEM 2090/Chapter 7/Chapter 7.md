## 7.1 Development of the Periodic Table
- 
## 7.2 Effective Nuclear Charge
- Each electron in a many electron atom is screened from the nucleus by the other electrons
- It experiences a net attraction that is smaller than it would experience in the absense of other electrons
- Nuclear Charge Z
	- $Z_e=Z-S$
	- For valence electrons S is the number of core electrons in the atom
- The effective nuclear charge increases from left to right across a period
- Going down a column the effective nuclear charge experienced by valance electrons changes less than it does across a period (increases?)
- Effective nuclear charge increases as we go down a column
## 7.3 Size of Atoms and Ions
- Van Der Waal Radius: Shortest distance separating two nuclei during collisions is twice the radii of the atoms
- Atomic Radius: Distance between nuclei when two atoms are bonded to each other d
- Bonding Atomic Radius: half of this bond distance
- In each group bonding atomic radius increases top to bottom
	- Increase in n of the outer electrons. Outer electrons have a greater probability of being farther from nucleus increasing radius
- In each period bonding atomic radius decreases from left to right
	- $Z_e$ increases across a period so this draws valance electrons closer to the nucleus 
- Cations are smaller than parent atoms and anions are larger
- Ionic radius increases as we move down a column in the periodic table
- When electrons are removed from an atom to form a cation it is always removed from the largest quantum number n 
- Isoelectronic Series: Group of ions with the same number of electrons
## 7.4 Ionization Energy and Electron Affinity
- Ionization Energy: Minimum energy needed to remove electron from ground state
- Low ionization energy are likely to form cations
- Electron Affinity: Energy change when electron is added to atom
	- Low electron affinities are likely to form anions
	- Greater the attraction between atom and electron the more negative electron affinity
- First Ionization Energy I is the energy needed to remove first electron
- I increases are we move left to right across a period
- I decreases as we move down any column
- s and p block elements have a larger range of I then transition metals
- Smaller atoms have higher ionization energies
- All ionization energies are positive; energy needs to be absorbed to remove electron
