- Orbital: Describes electrons in terms of probabilities visualized as electron clouds
	- Not orbits since the motion of a electron in an atom cannot be determined precisely (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle)
- n: positive integral values As n increases orbitals become larger 
- l : angular momentum quantum number for each value of n from 0 - (n-1)
	- 0: s, 1: p, 2: d, 3: f
	- 2,6, 10 ,14 add 4
- m: integral values between -l and l
	- When $l\neq0$ shape is non-spherical 
- Electron shell: Collection of orbitals with the same value of n
- Subshell: Set of orbitals that have the same n and l 
- Shell with principal quantum number n consists of n sub-shells
- Each subshell consists a specific number of orbitals
- The total number of orbitals in a shell is $n^2$
