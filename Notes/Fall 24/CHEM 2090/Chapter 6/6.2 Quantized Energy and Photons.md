- Energy can be released or absorbed by atoms only in chunks
- The energy of a single quantum is equal to a constant times the frequency of radiation
	- $E=h\nu$
	- Plank's Constant h : $6.626\times10^{-34}Js$
	- $\nu$ Frequency
- Matter can emit and abosrb energy only in multiples of hv
	- 3hv -> 3 quanta of energy have been emitted
- Photoelectric Effect: Light shining on a clean metal surface causes electrons to be emittted from the surface
	- A minimum frequency of light different for different metals is required for the emission of electrons
- Radiant energy striking the metal surface is like a stream of tiny energy packets
	- Each packet is like a particle of energy called a photon
- Each photon must have energy $E=h\nu$
- Energy of light depends on its frequency
