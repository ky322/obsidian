- In a many electron atom for a given n the energy of an orbital increases as l increases
- Orbitals with the same energy are degenerate
- $m_s$: spin magnetic quantum number: $+\frac 1 2, -\frac 1 2$
- Pauli Exclusion Principle: No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers $n,1,m_1, m_s$
- An orbital can hold a max of two electrons and must have opposite spins
