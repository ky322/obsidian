- Wave: Propagating disturbance that travels through a medium transporting energy as it moves through the medium
	- Drop a stone into a pound, energy of collision is dispersed by vertical displacements of water molecules
- Light wave is made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields
	- Electromagnetic radiation
- All types of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum at $2.998\times 10^8 m/s$
- Wavelength: Distance between two adjacent peaks or troughs
- Cycles: Number of wavelengths
- Frequency: Number of cycles per second
- All electromagnetic radiation moves at the spped of light
- Long wavelength fewer cycles so low frequency
- Wavelength $\lambda$, frequency $\nu$, speed of light $c$: $c = \nu \lambda$
- $E=hc/\lambda$
- $\lambda = h/mv$
