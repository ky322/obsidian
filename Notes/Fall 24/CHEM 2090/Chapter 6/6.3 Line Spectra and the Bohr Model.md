- polychromatic: Radiation containing different wavelengths
- Spectrum: Radiation from polychromatic source is separated into its component wavelength
- Rydberg Equation: Calculate wavelength of all spectral lines of hydrogen
	- $\frac 1 \lambda = R_H(\frac{1}{{n^2}_2^1}-\frac{1}{{n^2}_2^2})$
	- $\lambda$ wavelength of spectral line
	- $R_H$ Rydberg constant $1.096776\times10^7m^{-1}$
- Borh Postulates
	- Only orbits of certain radii corresponding to certain specific energies are permitted for the electron in a hydrogen atom
	- An electron in a permitted orbit is in an allowed energy state. An electron in an allowed energy state does not radiate energy and does not spiral into the nucleus
	- Energy is emitted or absorbed by the electron only as the electron changes from one allowed energy state to another. The energy emitted or absorbed as a photon that has energy $E=h\nu$
- Principal quantum Number: n in $-2.18\times10^{-18}J\frac 1 {n^2}$
	- The lower the energy the more stable the atom
- When n =1 ground state when n = 2 excited state
- Electron absorbs energy to move to a higher energy state and emit energy when jumps to lower energy state
- $\Delta E > 0$ Photon absorbed with $E_p=h\nu=\Delta E$
- $\Delta E < 0$ Photon absorbed emitted $E_p=h\nu=-\Delta E$
- Electrons exist only in certain discrete energy levels which are described by quantum numbers
- A discrete quantity of energy is either absorbed or emitted when an electron transitions from one level to another
