- Electron density for all s orbital spherically symmetric
- Describe position of the electron in terms of probability
- The square of the wave function $\psi^2$ gives the probability that the electron is located at any point in space
- Radial Probability Function: Total probability of finding the electron at a given distance from the nucleus we add up the probability densities over all points r from the radius
	- $4\pi r^2\psi(r)$
- For ns number of peaks = n outermost is the larger than inner
- For ns number of nodes n -1
	- Radial nodes
- As n increases electron density becomes more spread out so a greater probability of finding the electron further from the nucleus 
- p orbitals: Two lobes
	- $P_x,P_y,P_z$ where along the orbital is oriented
- d orbital: Four clover![[Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 9.15.53 PM.png]]
- Regions where the probability density function reduces to zero are called _nodes_ or _nodal surface_
- Number of radial nodes = n - l - 1
