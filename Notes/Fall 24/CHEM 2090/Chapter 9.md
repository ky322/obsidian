### Molecular Shape

### VSEPR Model
- Bonding Pair: Region where electrons are most likely to be found
- Nonbonding pair or lone pair: Electron domain that is located on one atom
- The best arrangement of electron domains is one that minimizes the repulsions around them
- ![[Screenshot 2024-11-13 at 12.28.49 PM.png]]
- Draw the Lewis structure of molecule then count number of electron domains around central atom
	- Each electron pair, single, double, triple bound counts as one electron domain
- Determine geometry
- Use arrangement of bonded atoms to determine molecular geometry![[Screenshot 2024-11-13 at 12.31.00 PM.png]]
- Electron domains for nonbonding electron pairs exert greater repulsive forces on adjacent electron domains and tend to compress bond angles
- Electron domains for multiple bonds exert a greater repulsive force on adjacent electron domains than single bonds

- Equatorial positions: 120 degrees with each one and 90 degrees with axial 
- Axial Positions: 90 degree with any domain in equatorial
- Non bonding domains always occupy the equitorial positions in a trigonal bipyramid because it exerts larger repulsion

 - Vector Points to more electronegative atom
### Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap
- Covalent bonds result from overlap of atomic orbitals
- The distance at the minimum of the potential energy curve is the bond length (x)
- The potential energy at this minimum is the bond strength (y)
- Bonds form via overlap of orbitals (HCl has H with 1 and Cl with 7)
### Hybrid Orbitals
- Hybridization: Mixing atomic orbitals
- A linear arrangement of electron domains is sp hybridization
- sp2 sp3
- How to describe the hybrid orbitals used by an atom in bonding
	- Draw Lewis structure for molecule
	- Use VSEPR model to determine electron domain geometry
	- Specify hybrid orbitals needed to accommodate electron pairs based on geometric arrangement

## Multiple Bonds
- $\sigma$ Bonds: Type of covalent bond along internuclear axis
	- Single bond
	- One pair of electrons is localized in the sapce between the atoms
- $\pi$ Bond: Overlap of p orbitals
	- Weaker than $\sigma$
	- Localized in region between two bonded atoms and do not make contribution to bonding between any other two atoms
- Double Bond: one $\sigma, \pi$
- Triple Bond: Two $\pi$, 1 $\sigma$
- When atoms share more than one pair of electrons one is for $\sigma$ and another for $\pi$ 
- $\pi$ systems can extend over two bonded atoms which are delocalized
## Molecular Orbitals
- When two atomic orbitals overlap two molecular orbitals form
- Bond Order: 1/2 (Number of bonding electrons - number of antibonding)
- 1: Single, 2: Double, 3: Triple
## Period 2 MO
- $B_2,C_2, N_2: \sigma_{2p} > \pi_{2p}$
- $O_2,F_2,Ne_2: \pi_{2p}> \sigma_{2p}$
- Paramagnetism: More unpaired electrons the stronger the attractive force
- Diamagnetism: No unpaired electrons weakly repelled by magnetic field
- As bond order increases, bond distance decrease and bond enthalpy increase
- A hetero nuclear diatomic molecule has a greater contribution from the atomic orbital to which it is closer in energy to
