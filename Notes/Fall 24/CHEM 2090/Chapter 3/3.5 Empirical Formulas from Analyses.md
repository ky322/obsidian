- The ratio of the numbers of moles in all elements in a compound gives subscripts in the compounds empirical formula
- Given Mass % element 
	1. Assume 100g sample to get grams of each element
	2. Use molar mass for moles of each element
	3. Calculate mole ratio for empirical formula
- Whole number multiple = molecular weight/ empirical formula weight
- Combustion Analysis: Calculate number of moles of C and H in original sample and then the empirical formula
- Isopropyl alcohol, sold as rubbing alcohol, is composed of C, H, and O. Combustion of 0.255 g of isopropyl alcohol produces 0.561 g of CO2 and 0.306 g of H2O. Determine the empirical formula of isopropyl alcohol.
	- Grams C = (0.561g $CO_2$)($\frac{1 mol CO_2}{44 g CO_2}$)($\frac{1 mol C}{1 mol CO_2}$)($\frac{12 g C}{1 mol C}$) = 0.153g C
	- Grams H = (0.306g $H_2O$)($\frac{1 mol H_2O}{18 g H_2O}$)($\frac{2 mol H}{1 mol H_2O}$)($\frac{1.01 g H}{1 mol H}$) = 0.0343 H
	- Grams O = Mass sample - (Mass C + H) = 0.068 g O
	- Moles C = (0.153 g C)($\frac{1 mol C}{12 g C}$) = 0.0128 mol C, 0.0340 mole H, 0.0043 mole O
	- C: 0.0128/0.0043 = 3, H: 8, O: 1
