## 3.1
- Stoichiometry: Examines quantities of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions
- Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction
- Reactants -> Products
	- s, g, l, aq
- $\Delta$: addition of heat
## 3.2
- Combination Reactions: Two or more substances react to form one product
	- s+g -> g
	- s + l -> aq
- Decomposition Reaction: Reactant breaks apart two form two or more substances
	- s -> s + g
- Combustion Reactions: Rapid Reactions that produce a flame
	- $O_2$: reactant
## 3.3
- Formula Weight: Sum of atomic weights of the chemical formula
- Molecular Weight: Chemical formula
- % mass composition of element = (number of atoms)(atomic weight)/formula weight * 100%

## 3.4
- Mole: amount of matter that contains as any of objects as the number of atoms in 12g of $^{12}C$
- Avogadro's Number: 6.02x10^23
- 1 mol $^{12}C$ atoms = $6.02\times 10^{23}$ $^{12}C$ atoms
- 1 mol $H_2O$ molecules = $6.02\times 10^{23}$ $H_2O$ molecules
- Convert to C Atoms
- Mole: Same number $6.02\times 10^{23}$ but different masses
- The atomic weight of an element in atomic mass units is equal to the mass in grams of 1 mol of that element
- Molar mass: g/mol the formula weight in amu
	- N: 14.0 amu (FW), 14 g/mol (Molar Mass), $6.02\times 10^{23}$ N atoms (One Mole)
- Conversion: Cu Atoms = $(3g)(\frac{1 mol Cu}{63.5g Cu})(\frac{6.02\times10^{23}Cu atoms}{1 mol Cu})= 3\times10^{22}atoms$
## 3.5
- The ratio of the numbers of moles in all elements in a compound gives subscripts in the compounds empirical formula
- Given Mass % element 
	1. Assume 100g sample to get grams of each element
	2. Use molar mass for moles of each element
	3. Calculate mole ratio for empirical formula
- Whole number multiple = molecular weight/ empirical formula weight
- Combustion Analysis: Calculate number of moles of C and H in original sample and then the empirical formula
- Isopropyl alcohol, sold as rubbing alcohol, is composed of C, H, and O. Combustion of 0.255 g of isopropyl alcohol produces 0.561 g of CO2 and 0.306 g of H2O. Determine the empirical formula of isopropyl alcohol.
	- Grams C = (0.561g $CO_2$)($\frac{1 mol CO_2}{44 g CO_2}$)($\frac{1 mol C}{1 mol CO_2}$)($\frac{12 g C}{1 mol C}$) = 0.153g C
	- Grams H = (0.306g $H_2O$)($\frac{1 mol H_2O}{18 g H_2O}$)($\frac{2 mol H}{1 mol H_2O}$)($\frac{1.01 g H}{1 mol H}$) = 0.0343 H
	- Grams O = Mass sample - (Mass C + H) = 0.068 g O
	- Moles C = (0.153 g C)($\frac{1 mol C}{12 g C}$) = 0.0128 mol C, 0.0340 mole H, 0.0043 mole O
	- C: 0.0128/0.0043 = 3, H: 8, O: 1

## 3.6
- $2H_2+O_2= 2H_2O$
	- 2 molecules + 1 molecule  = 2 molecules
	- 2($6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules) + 1($6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules) = 2($6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules)
	- 2 mol + 1 mol = 2 mol
- The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation indicate the relative number of molecules in the reaction and relative number of moles
- Procedure for Calculating reactants comsumed or products formed in a reaction
- Given grams of A:
	1. Use molar mass of A to get moles of substance A
	2. Use coefficients form balanced equation to get moles of B
	3. Use molar mass of B to get grams of B
- Mass of $CO_2$ produced when $C_4H_{10}$ is burned
	- Grams $CO_2 = 1g C_4H_{10}(\frac{1 mol C_4H_{10}}{58 g C_4H_{10}})(\frac{8 mol CO_2}{2 mol C_4H_{10}})(\frac{44g CO_2}{1 mol CO_2}) = 3.03g CO_2$
	- $2C_4H_{10}+ 13O_2\rightarrow8CO_2+ 10 H_2O$
## 3.7
- Limiting Reactant: Reactant completely consumed
- Percent yield = actual yield/theoretical yield * 100%
