- $2H_2+O_2= 2H_2O$
	- 2 molecules + 1 molecule  = 2 molecules
	- 2($6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules) + 1($6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules) = 2($6.02\times10^{23}$ molecules)
	- 2 mol + 1 mol = 2 mol
- The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation indicate the relative number of molecules in the reaction and relative number of moles
- Procedure for Calculating reactants comsumed or products formed in a reaction
- Given grams of A:
	1. Use molar mass of A to get moles of substance A
	2. Use coefficients form balanced equation to get moles of B
	3. Use molar mass of B to get grams of B
- Mass of $CO_2$ produced when $C_4H_{10}$ is burned
	- Grams $CO_2 = 1g C_4H_{10}(\frac{1 mol C_4H_{10}}{58 g C_4H_{10}})(\frac{8 mol CO_2}{2 mol C_4H_{10}})(\frac{44g CO_2}{1 mol CO_2}) = 3.03g CO_2$
	- $2C_4H_{10}+ 13O_2\rightarrow8CO_2+ 10 H_2O$
