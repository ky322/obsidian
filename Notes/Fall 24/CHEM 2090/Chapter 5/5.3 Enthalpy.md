- $H=E+PV$
	- H, E, P, V state functions (does not depend on path to reach state)
- Constant pressure: $w=-P\Delta V$
	- P: Positive or 0
	- $\Delta V$: Positive if expands but negative if compresses
	- 1 L atm = 101.3J
- Change in enthalpy equals heat $q_p$ gained or lost by the system at constant pressure
	- $\Delta H=\Delta E + P\Delta V = q_p$
