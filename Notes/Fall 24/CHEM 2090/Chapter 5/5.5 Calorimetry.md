- Heat capacity C: Temperature change by an object when it absorbs a certain about of heat
	- Amount of heat required to raise temperature by 1 K
	- Greater the heat capacity the greater the heat required to produce a given increase in temperature
- Molar Heat capacity $C_m$: Heat capacity of one mole of a substance
- Specific Heat Capacity $C_s$: Heat capacity of one gram of a substance
	- quantity of heat transferred/(grams of substance)(temperature change)
	- $C_s=\frac{q}{m\Delta T}$
	- $q=mC_s\Delta T$
	- $q=nC_p\Delta T$
	- $q_{sol}=-q_{rxn}$
- $q_{rxn}=-C_{cal}\times\Delta T$
