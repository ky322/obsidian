- $\Delta H = H_p-H_r$
- Thermochemical Equation: Balanced Chemical equations that show the associated enthalpy change
- $\Delta H$ is proportional to amount of reactants consumed in procress
- Enthalpy change for a reaction is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to $\Delta H$ for reverse reaction
	- Reverse reaction we reverse roles of product and reactants
- Enthalpy change for a reaction depends on states of reactants and products
