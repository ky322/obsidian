- Enthalpy of Formation or heat of formation $\Delta H_f$: substance has been formed from elements
- $\Delta H^\degree$: Standard enthalpy change when all reactants and products are in standard state
- Standard Enthalpy of Formation $\Delta H_f^\degree$: Change in enthalpy for reaction that forms one mole of the compound from its elements with all substances in standard state
