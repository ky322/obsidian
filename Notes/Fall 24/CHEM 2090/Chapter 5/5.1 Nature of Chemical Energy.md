- Energy: Capacity to do work or transfer heat
- Work: $w=F\times d$
- Electrostatic Potential Energy: $E=\frac{kQ_1Q_2}{d}$
	- As $d\rightarrow\infty, E\rightarrow 0$
- Energy is released when chemical bonds are formed
- Energy is consumed when chemical bonds are broken
- To bring two positive charge objects together we have to do work to overcome the repulsive force between them
