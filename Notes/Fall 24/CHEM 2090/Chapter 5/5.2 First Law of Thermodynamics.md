- Energy can be converted from one form to another but is neither created nor destroyed
- Open System: Matter and energy can be exchanged with surroundings
- Closed System: exchange energy but not matter with surroundings
- Isolated System: Neither energy nor matter can be exchanged with surroundings
- Internal Energy E: Sum of all kinetic and potential energy in system
	- $\Delta E= E_f-E_i$
	- Number, unit, sign
	- $\Delta E > 0$: System gained energy
	- $\Delta E < 0$: System lost energy
- $\Delta E=q + w$
	- q positive when system gains heat from surroundings
	- work positive when work is done on system by surroundings
	- Overall net gain of energy
- Endothermic: system absorbs heat
- Exothermic: system losses heat
- State Function: Property of system determined by specifying the system's condition
	- Value of state function depends only on present state of system not the path the system look to reach that state
	- q and w are not state functions: depends on path but $\Delta E$ does not depend on path
