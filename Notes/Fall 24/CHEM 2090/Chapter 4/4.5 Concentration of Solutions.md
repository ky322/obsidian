- Molarity (M): Concentration of a solution as number of moles of solute in a liter of solution $$Molarity = \frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{volume of solution in L}}$$
- Concentration of electrolyte solution can be specified by compound used to make solution or ions in the solution
- Moles solute before dilution = moles solute after dilution
	- $M_c\times V_c = M_d * V_d$
