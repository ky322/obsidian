- Precipitation Reactions: Reactions that result in the formation of insoluble product
- Precipitate: Insoluable solid formed by a reaction in solution
- Solubility: Amount of substance that can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent
	- Insoluble: < 0.01 mol/L
	- Attraction between the opposite ions in the solid is too great for the water molecule to separate the ions

- How to predict if a precipitate forms when strong electrolytes mix
	- Note all ions in the reactants
	- Consider cation-anion combinations
	- use table to determine if any is insoluble
- Exchange Reactions: Cations and Anions exchange partners $AX+BY\rightarrow AY+BX$
	- Precipitation reactions
- How to balance
	- Determine ions present
	- Write products by combining cations with the anions of the other and use ionic charges to determine subscripts
	- Check water solubility of products. We need at least one product to be insoluble for precipitation
	- Balance equation 
- Spectator Ions: Ions that appear identical on both sides of a complete ionic equation 
- Net Ionic Equation: Only includes ions and molecules involved in reaction
	- If every ion is spectator no reaction 
- How to Write a Net Ionic Equation
	- Write balanced molecular equation
	- Rewrite to show ions that form in solution when each soluble strong electrolyte dissociates into its ions
		- Only strong electrolytes dissolved in aqueous solution are written in ionic form
	- Cancel spectator ions
