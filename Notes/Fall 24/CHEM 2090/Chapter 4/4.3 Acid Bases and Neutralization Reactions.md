- Acids: Substances that ionize in aqeuous solution to form $H^+(aq)$
	- Proton donors
- Bases: Substances that accept $H^+(aq)$ ions and produce $OH^-$ ions when dissolve in water
	- Does not have to contain the ion $NH_3$ is one
	- Weak electrolyte since 1% forms the ions
- Strong Acids and Strong Bases: Acids and bases that are strong electrolytes (completely ionize in solution)
- Weak acids and Weak Bases: Weak Electrolytes (partly ionized)![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.14.47 AM.png]]

- Neutralization Reaction between an acid and metal hydroxide produces water and a salt
