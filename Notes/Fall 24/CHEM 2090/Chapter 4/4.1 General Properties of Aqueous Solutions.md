- Electrolyte: Substance whose aqueous solutions contain ions
- NonElectrolyte: Substance that does not form ions in solution
- Ionic Solid dissociates into its component ions as it dissolves
- Solvation: Stabilize ions in solution and prevents cations and anions from recombining
- Ionize: Dissociates into ions
- Strong Electrolytes: Solutes in solution completely or nearly completely as ions
- Weak Electrolytes: Solutes that exist in solution mostly as neutral molecules with small amount of ions
	- Do not use solubility as strong or weak
- Reaction when weak electrolyte ionizes in solution
	- $CH_3COOH(aq)\rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^-(aq)+H^+(aq)$
	- Chemical Equilibrium: Number of ions or molecules are constant over time
	- Half Arrows: Reactions go forward and backwards for equilibrium 
- Reaction strong electrolyte:
	- $HCL(aq)\rightarrow H^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$
	- Ions have no tendency to recombine to form HCl
- Water soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes
	- Exception: Ionic Compounds containing $NH_4^+$
