- Oxidation: Loss of electrons
- Reduction: Gain electrons
- Oxidation Numbers
	- Atom in elemental form: 0
	- Monoatomic Ion: Ionic Charge
	- Non Metals: Negative Oxidation Numbers
	- Hydrogen: +1 when bounded to nonmetal and -1 when bounded to metals
	- Fluorine: -1
		- Halogens: -1 in most binary but bounded with oxygen is positive
	- Sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0
	- Sum in polyatomic ion equals charge of ion
- Displacement Reactions: Ion is displaced through oxidation $A+BX\rightarrow AX+B$
	- Metal and acid or metal salt reaction
- Whenever one substance is oxidized another must be reduced
- Activitiy Series: Metals arranged in order of decreasing ease of exoidation
	- Active Metals: Alkali metals easily oxidize; react to form compounds
	- Noble metals: Low reactiviity
		- bottom of activity series 
		- Stable and form compounds less readily
- Any metal on the list can be oxidized by the ions of elemnts below it![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.26.13 AM.png]]![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.26.38 AM.png]]
- Only metals above hydrogen can react with acids to form $H_2$
