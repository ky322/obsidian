## 4.1
- Electrolyte: Substance whose aqueous solutions contain ions
- NonElectrolyte: Substance that does not form ions in solution
- Ionic Solid dissociates into its component ions as it dissolves
- Solvation: Stabilize ions in solution and prevents cations and anions from recombining
- Ionize: Dissociates into ions
- Strong Electrolytes: Solutes in solution completely or nearly completely as ions
- Weak Electrolytes: Solutes that exist in solution mostly as neutral molecules with small amount of ions
	- Do not use solubility as strong or weak
- Reaction when weak electrolyte ionizes in solution
	- $CH_3COOH(aq)\rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^-(aq)+H^+(aq)$
	- Chemical Equilibrium: Number of ions or molecules are constant over time
	- Half Arrows: Reactions go forward and backwards for equilibrium 
- Reaction strong electrolyte:
	- $HCL(aq)\rightarrow H^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$
	- Ions have no tendency to recombine to form HCl
- Water soluble ionic compounds are strong electrolytes
	- Exception: Ionic Compounds containing $NH_4^+$
	- 
## 4.2
- Precipitation Reactions: Reactions that result in the formation of insoluble product
- Precipitate: Insoluble solid formed by a reaction in solution
- Solubility: Amount of substance that can be dissolved in a given quantity of solvent
	- Insoluble: < 0.01 mol/L
	- Attraction between the opposite ions in the solid is too great for the water molecule to separate the ions

- How to predict if a precipitate forms when strong electrolytes mix
	- Note all ions in the reactants
	- Consider cation-anion combinations
	- use table to determine if any is insoluble
- Exchange Reactions: Cations and Anions exchange partners $AX+BY\rightarrow AY+BX$
	- Precipitation reactions
- How to balance
	- Determine ions present
	- Write products by combining cations with the anions of the other and use ionic charges to determine subscripts
	- Check water solubility of products. We need at least one product to be insoluble for precipitation
	- Balance equation 
- Spectator Ions: Ions that appear identical on both sides of a complete ionic equation 
- Net Ionic Equation: Only includes ions and molecules involved in reaction
	- If every ion is spectator no reaction 
- How to Write a Net Ionic Equation
	- Write balanced molecular equation
	- Rewrite to show ions that form in solution when each soluble strong electrolyte dissociates into its ions
		- Only strong electrolytes dissolved in aqueous solution are written in ionic form
	- Cancel spectator ions
## 4.3
- Acids: Substances that ionize in aqeuous solution to form $H^+(aq)$
	- Proton donors
- Bases: Substances that accept $H^+(aq)$ ions and produce $OH^-$ ions when dissolve in water
	- Does not have to contain the ion $NH_3$ is one
	- Weak electrolyte since 1% forms the ions
- Strong Acids and Strong Bases: Acids and bases that are strong electrolytes (completely ionize in solution)
- Weak acids and Weak Bases: Weak Electrolytes (partly ionized)![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.14.47 AM.png]]

- Neutralization Reaction between an acid and metal hydroxide produces water and a salt
	- Salt: Ionic compound whose cation comes from a case and anion from an acid
## 4.4
- Oxidation: Loss of electrons
- Reduction: Gain electrons
- Oxidation Numbers
	- Atom in elemental form: 0
	- Monoatomic Ion: Ionic Charge
	- Non Metals: Negative Oxidation Numbers
	- Hydrogen: +1 when bounded to nonmetal and -1 when bounded to metals
	- Fluorine: -1
		- Halogens: -1 in most binary but bounded with oxygen is positive
	- Sum of oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is 0
	- Sum in polyatomic ion equals charge of ion
- Displacement Reactions: Ion is displaced through oxidation $A+BX\rightarrow AX+B$
	- Metal and acid or metal salt reaction
- Whenever one substance is oxidized another must be reduced
- Activitiy Series: Metals arranged in order of decreasing ease of exoidation
	- Active Metals: Alkali metals easily oxidize; react to form compounds
	- Noble metals: Low reactiviity
		- bottom of activity series 
		- Stable and form compounds less readily
- Any metal on the list can be oxidized by the ions of elemnts below it![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.26.13 AM.png]]![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 12.26.38 AM.png]]
- Only metals above hydrogen can react with acids to form $H_2$
- 
## 4.5
- Molarity (M): Concentration of a solution as number of moles of solute in a liter of solution $$Molarity = \frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{volume of solution in L}}$$
- Concentration of electrolyte solution can be specified by compound used to make solution or ions in the solution
- Moles solute before dilution = moles solute after dilution
	- $M_c\times V_c = M_d * V_d$
