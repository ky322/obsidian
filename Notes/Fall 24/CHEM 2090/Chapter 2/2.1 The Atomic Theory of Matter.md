Dalton's Atomic Theory
- Each element is composed of extremely small particles called atoms
- All atoms of a given element are identical but the atoms of one element are different from the atoms of all other elements
- Atoms of one element cannot be changed into atoms of a different element by chemical reactions
	- Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions
- Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one combine
	- A compound has the same relative number and kind of atoms
- Law of Constant Composition: Relative numbers and kinds of atoms are constant
- Law of Conservation of Mass: Total mass of materials present after a chemical reaction is the same as total mass present before the reaction
- Law of Multiple Proportions: If elements A and B combine to form more than one compound, the masses of B than combine with A are in the ratio of small whole numbers
