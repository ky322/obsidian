## 2.1
Dalton's Atomic Theory
- Each element is composed of extremely small particles called atoms
- All atoms of a given element are identical but the atoms of one element are different from the atoms of all other elements
- Atoms of one element cannot be changed into atoms of a different element by chemical reactions
	- Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions
- Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one combine
	- A compound has the same relative number and kind of atoms
- Law of Constant Composition: Relative numbers and kinds of atoms are constant
- Law of Conservation of Mass: Total mass of materials present after a chemical reaction is the same as total mass present before the reaction
- Law of Multiple Proportions: If elements A and B combine to form more than one compound, the masses of B than combine with A are in the ratio of small whole numbers
## 2.2
- Particles with the same charge repel, opposite charges attract
- Cathode: Negatively charged electrode
- Anode: Positively charged electrode
- Thomson: Cathode rays -> Electrons
	- Electrons have mass
	- Proposed atom consists of a uniform positive sphere of matter where mass is evenly distributed and electrons are embedded 
	- Plum Pudding Model
- Millikan: Measuring change of an electron
	- Oil Drop experiment
- Rutherford: 3 types of radiation $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$
	- Gold Foil Experiment: Nuclear model of the atom
## 2.3
- Every atom has an equal number of electrons and protons
	- Atoms have no electrical charge
- 1 amu = $1.66054 \times 10^{-24}g$
	- 1 proton = 1.0073 amu, Neutron 1.0087, Electron 5.486* 10 ^-4 amu
- Atomic Number: Number of protons in an atom
- Mass Number: Protons + Neutrons
- Isotope: Atoms with identical atomic numbers but different mass numbers
## 2.4
Atomic Weight: Average Atomic Mass
## 2.5
- Periodic Table: Increasing atomic number and similar properties vertically
- Horizontal Rows: Periods
- Vertical: Groups
## 2.6
- Molecular Form: Two or more of the same type of atom bound together
- Diatomic Molecule: Molecule made up of two atoms
	- $H_2, O_2, N_2, F_2, Cl_2, Br_2, I_2$
- Molecular Compounds: Molecules that contain more than one type of atom
	- Contains only nonmetals
- Molecular Formulas: Actual numbers of atoms in a molecule
- Empirical Formulas: Chemical formulas that give relative number of atoms in each type in a molecule
## 2.7
- Ion: Electrons are removed from or added to an atom
- Cation: Ion with positive charge
- Anion: Negatively charged Ion
- Gain Electrons: - Charge
- Loss Electron: + charge
- Metal atoms lose electrons to form cations, nonmetals gain electrons to form anions
- Ionic compounds composed of metal cations and nonmetal anions
- Polyatomic ions: Atoms joined as in a molecule but carry a net positive or negative charge
- Noble Gases: Nonreactive elements that form very few compounds
- Empirical Formula for Ionic Compound If we know Charges of Ion: $Mg^{2+}N^3\rightarrow Mg_3N_2$
