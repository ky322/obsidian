- Ion: Electrons are removed from or added to an atom
- Cation: Ion with positive charge
- Anion: Negatively charged Ion
- Gain Electrons: - Charge
- Loss Electron: + charge
- Metal atoms lose electrons to form cations, nonmetals gain electrons to form anions
- Ionic compounds composed of metal cations and nonmetal anions
- Polyatomic ions: Atoms joined as in a molecule but carry a net positive or negative charge
- Noble Gases: Nonreactive elements that form very few compounds
- Empirical Formula for Ionic Compound If we know Charges of Ion: $Mg^{2+}N^3\rightarrow Mg_3N_2$
