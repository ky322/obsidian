## 8.1 Lewis Symbols and Octet 
- Valence Electrons: Electrons involved in chemical bonding
- Atoms tend to gain or lose shared electrons until they are surrounded by eight valence electrons
	- Apply to atoms that have s and p valence electrons
## 8.2 Ionic Bonding
- When nonmetal gains electron the process is exothermic
- Lattice energy: Energy required to separate one mole of solid ionic compound into gaseous ions
	- Measure of how much stabilization results from arranging oppositely charged ions into ionic solid
	- Increases as charges on ions increase and radii decrease
## 8.3 Covalent Bonding
- Covalent Bond: Chemical bond formed by sharing a pair of electrons
- Length of bond between two atoms decrease as number of shared electron pairs increase
## 8.4 Bond Polarity and Electronegativity
- Bond Polarity: How equal the electrons in any covalent bond are shared
- Non polar Covalent Bond: Electrons shared equally
- Polar Covalent Bond: An atom exerts a greater attraction for the bonding electrons
- Electronegativity: Determines type of bond
	- Ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself
	- Increase left to right and decreases top to bottom
- The greater the difference in electronegativity to more polar the bond
- $\mu = Qr$ where $\mu$ is dipole moment
- Covalent Bonding
	- Compounds exist as molecules
	- Low melting and boiling points
	- Non electrolyte behavior when dissolved in water
- Ionic
	- Brittle high melting solid with extended lattice structures
	- Strong electrolyte
- 0-0.3; 0.3-2.0; 2.1-4.0
## 8.5 Drawing Lewis Structures
- Sum valence electrons from all atoms
- Write symbols and connect with single bond
- Complete octets to atoms bonded to central atom
- Place remaining on central atom
	- If not enough use multiple bonds
- Formal Charge of any atom in a molecule: Charge atom would have if bonding electron pair in molecules are shared equally between two atoms
	- All unshared electrons are assigned to atom 
	- For any bond half bonding electrons
	- Subtract number of electrons from number of valence electrons in neutral atom
	- Formal Charge = valence electrons - ($\frac 1 2$ bonding electrons + non bonding electrons)
- Dominant Lewis structure: Lowest formal charge
	- structure where negative charge reside on more electronegative atoms is more dominant that one with negative charges on less electronegative atoms
## 8.6 Resonance Structures
- Resonance: Multiple Lewis structures
	- Two equivalent dominant Lewis structures that contribute equally to the actual structure of molecule
## 8.7 Exceptions to Octet Rule
- Odd number of electrons
- Less than octet of valence electrons
- More than octet of valence electrons
	- Hypervalent
	- Formed for central atoms from period 3 and below
- Check formal charge
## 8.8 Strengths and Lengths of Single and Multiple Bonds
- multiple bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds
- Not all bonds between a pair of atoms have the same strength
