### Chapter 14.1
- Chemical reactions involve a transfer of energy between the reaction system and its surroundings
- Transfer of energy as work involves the action of a force through a distance
	- Work done on the system: $w=-F\Delta h$
- Work done by the system during expansion is negative because energy is lost by the system to the surroundings when the system does work
- When the work is positive the system gains energy; when the work is negative the system loses energy
- $w=-PA\Delta h=-P\Delta V=-P(V_f-V_i)$
- Transfer of energy as heat does not need the application of a force
- Energy transfer as heat (q) occurs whenever there is a temperature difference between a system and its surroundings
- Exothermic Reaction: Reaction that releases energy as heat into the surroundings
	- q<0
- Endothermic Reaction: Heat is transferred from surroundings into the system
	- q > 0
- Energy Change of a System: $\Delta U=U_f-U_i=q+w$
- First Law of Thermodynamics: In going from some particular initial energy state to some final energy state, the energy transferred as work and heat must add to the same value as $\Delta U$
- State Functions: Functions that depend only on the state of a system and not how the state is achieved
- Work and heat are energy transfer functions
- Energy Change of Reaction $\Delta U_{rxn}=q+w$
### Chapter 14.2
- Enthalpy: Reactions that occur at constant pressure $H=U+PV$
- $\Delta H_{rxn}=\Delta U_{rxn}+P\Delta V_{rxn}=q_p={\text{energy evolved or absorbed as heat at constant pressure}}$
- $\Delta H_{rxn}=H_{prod}-H_{react}$
- $\Delta H^o_{rxn}$: Standard Enthalpy Change
### Chapter 14.3
- $\Delta H^o_{rxn}=\Delta U^o_{rxn}+P\Delta V^o_{rxn}$
