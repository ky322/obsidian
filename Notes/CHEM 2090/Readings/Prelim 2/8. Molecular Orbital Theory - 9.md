### Chapter 9.1
- Molecular Orbital: Extends over both nuclei in the molecule
	- Combining atomic orbitals on different atoms
	- When electrons occupy these orbitals the buildup of electron density between the nuclei results in a covalent bond
- Energies correspond to electron densities
### Chapter 9.2
- Homonuclear diatomic Molecules: Diatomic molecules where both nuclei are the same
- Bonding Orbital: The lowest $H_2$ molecular orbital can be generated by adding 1s orbitals on the two hydrogen atoms and the resultant concentration of the electronic charge between the nuclei tends to draw the nuclei together and is responsible for the bond in the ground electronic state
- Internuclear axis: The axis drawn between the nuclei of the two bonding atoms
- $\sigma$ orbitals: Molecular orbitals that have a circular cross section along the internuclear axis
	- atomic s orbitals have a circular cross section
- The ground state orbital of a $H_2+$ ion is a $\sigma_{1s}$ orbital because it is constructed from two hydrogen 1s orbitals
- The next orbital can be generated by subtracting 1s orbitals on the hydrogen atoms
	- The resultant molecular orbital is also symmetric about the internuclear axis so it is $\sigma$ orbital
	- It is a nodal plane midway between the nuclei and perpendicular to the internuclear axis
		- Nodal surfaces: Surfaces on which an orbital is 0
- Antibonding Orbital: The electrons in this orbital are concentrated on the far sides of the two nuclei and draw the nuclei away from each other
- The buildup of molecular orbital between the nuclei corresponds to the electron density being accumulated which results in a chemical bond
- When 1s orbitals are subtracted they cancel each other midway between the nuclei
	- The cancellation leads to a region in which the electron is unlikely to be found and a nodal plane
- Internuclear Distance: Distance between two atomic nuclei

- Combination of 2s orbitals
- molecular orbitals have cylindrical symmetry thus indeed $\sigma$ orbitals
- We can combine 2p atomic orbitals on the hydrogen atoms
	-

- $\pi$ orbital: Positive and negative lobes overlap so the resulting molecular orbital has a cross section along the internuclear axis similar to the p orbitals
- ![[Pasted image 20240103191010.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20240103191100.png]]
- Degenerate: Two or more orbitals that have the same energies
- Only orbitals of similar energies combine effectively
### Chapter 9.3
- The strength of a covalent bond is predicted by its bond order
- ![[Pasted image 20240104093533.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20240104093542.png]]
- Bond Order =  (Number of electrons in bonding orbital - number of electrons in antibonding orbitals) / 2
	- 1/2 = One electron bond
	- 1 = Single bond
	- 2 = Double bond
	- 0 = Two atoms do not form a stable covalent bond under normal conditions
- Bond lengths decreases and bond energies increase with increasing bond order

### Chapter 9.4
- Molecular orbital theory predicts the electron configuration of diatomic molecules
- We can use the ordering of the molecular orbitals for Z=1 - Z=7 where Z is the atomic number
- For Z>7 the order of $\sigma_{2p}$ and $\pi_{2p}$ varies

- ![[Pasted image 20240104160352.png]]
- Paramagnetic: Weakly attracted to a region between the poles of a magnet
- Diamagnetic: They are slightly repelled by a magnetic field
### Chapter 9.5
- Localized Bond Orbitals: Localized along the line joining each atom to the central atom
- Localized Covalent Bond: Each pair of electrons that occupies a localized bond orbital
- Hybrid Orbital: Combination of atomic orbitals of the same atom
- sp orbitals: Formed from 2s orbital and one 2p orbital
	- Each one provides a large region to combine with a hydrogen 1s orbital
	- They are 180 degrees apart
- $\sigma$ bond: $\sigma$ orbital is occupied by two electrons of opposite spins
### Chapter 9.6
- $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals have trigonal planar symmetry
- Formed from 2s and two 2p orbitals
- Principle of Conservation of Orbitals: If we combine atomic orbitals on the same atom to form hybrid orbitals the number of resulting hybrid orbitals is equal to the number of atomic orbitals combined
### Chapter 9.7
- $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals point toward the vertices of a tetrahedron
- Formed from 2s and three 2p orbitals
### Chapter 9.8
- Nonbonded Orbital: Two lone electron pairs 
	- sp
### Chapter 9.9
- $sp^3d$ orbitals
- ![[Pasted image 20240104234142.png]]
### Chapter 9.10
- Double Bond: $\sigma$ and $\pi$ bond
### Chapter 9.11
- A large amount of energy is needed to break a $\pi$ bond so no rotation occurs about a double bond at room temperature
	- cis-trans isomerism
### Chapter 9.12
- Triple Bond: $\sigma$ bond and two $\pi$ bonds
### Chapter 9.13
- The $\pi$ electrons in benzene are delocalized
### Summary
- Once a geometry of a molecule is known we can choose a hybrid orbital to describe localized bonding
- $\sigma$ bond orbital occupied by two electrons of opposite spins constitute a $\sigma$ bond and bond orbitals are cylindrically symmetric about the bond axis
