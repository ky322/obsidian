### Chapter 12.1
- Saturated Solution: No more sodium chloride can dissolve
- Solubility: Maximum quantity of solute dissolved
	- Grams of solute per 100 grams of solvent
- Unsaturated Solution: A solution where we can dissolve more of the solute
- Solubility of a substance depends on temperature
### Chapter 12.2
- Molarity: Concentration of a solute
	- Number of moles of solute per liter of solution
	- Molarity (M) = moles of solute (n)/ liters of solution (V)
	- n=MV
- Concentration of a solute in a solution: Quantity of solute dissolved in a given quantity of solvent or solution
- When we dilute a solution the volume of solvent increases but number of moles of solute stays the same
### Chapter 12.3
- Solutions that contain ions conduct an electric current
- Electrolytes: ionic substances whose aqueous solutions conduct an electric current
- Nonelectrolytes: covalent substances whose aqueous solutions do not conduct an electric current
- When a strong electrolyte dissolves in water all formula units dissociate in solution into free ions which are available to conduct an electric current
- When a weak electrolyte dissolves in water only a small fraction of formula units dissociate into ions making it a poorer conductor at the same concentration
- Predict whether a substance is a strong weak or non electrolyte
	1. The acids HCl(aq), HBr(aq), HI(aq), HNO3 (aq), H2 SO 4 (aq), and HClO 4 (aq) are strong electrolytes. Most other acids are weak electrolytes
	2. The soluble hydroxides of the Group 1 and 2 metals are strong electrolytes. Most other bases, and particularly ammonia, are weak electrolytes
	3. Most soluble salts (Table 10.9) are strong electrolytes in aqueous solution
	4. The halides and cyanides of the “heavy metals” (i.e., those with high atomic numbers), for example, mercury and lead, are often weak electrolytes
	5. Most organic compounds, that is, compounds that consist of carbon, hydrogen, and possibly other atoms, are nonelectrolytes. Notable exceptions are organic acids and bases, which are usually weak electrolytes.
- Degree of Dissociation: The extend to which a compound dissociates into ions in solutions
	- Obtained by determining electrical conductance of solution
	- The greater the degree of dissociation the more ions in solution greater electrical conductance
- Molar conductance to compare conductivities of salt on per mole
	- Electrical conductivity of solution per mole of dissolved compound
