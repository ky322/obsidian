### Chapter 11.1
- Mole: Quantity of a substance that is equal to its formula mass in grams
- Molar Mass: Number of grams needed to make up one mole of the compound
### Chapter 11.2
- One mole of any substance contains $6.022\times 10^{23}$ formula units
	- Avogadro's Number
- One mole is the mass of a substance containing Avogadro's number of formula units
	- 1 mol Al = $6.022\times 10^{23}$ Al atoms = 26.98g Al
### Chapter 11.3
- Stoichiometry: Calculation of the quantities of elements or compounds involved in chemical reactions
- Simplest formula: Only ratios of atoms in chemical formula; Empirical formulas
	- Find grams then moles = atoms
- If we know the chemical formula we can determine mass percentage of an element in the formula
### Chapter 11.4
- Empirical Formulas can be used to determine unknown atomic mass
### Chapter 11.5
- Empirical formula and molecular mass determines molecular formula
- The factor is determined by molecular mass/empirical formula mass
### Chapter 11.6
- Percentage composition of compounds can be determined by combustion analysis
- Combustion analysis: Analysis of products obtained when organic compound is burned in an excess of oxygen
- the mass of carbon in the original sample is equal to the mass of carbon in the carbon dioxide formed
- we can find the mass percentages of carbon and hydrogen in the compound
- Find the excess oxygen amount
### Chapter 11.7
- Coefficients in chemical reactions can be interpreted as number of moles
- Balancing coefficients are the relative numbers of moles of each substance in a balanced chemical equation
- the stoichiometric unit conversion factors are identical because they consist of ratios of stoichiometric coefficients
### Chapter 11.8
- Calculations involving chemical reactions are carried out in terms of moles
- procedure for calculating the mass or the number of moles from chemical equations
	- Given a mass of one of the reactants or products
		- Divide by the atomic or the molecular mass
	- Number of moles of the reactant or product
		- Use the balancing coefficients in the chemical equation as a stoichiometric unit conversion factor
	- Number of moles of some other reactant or product
		- Multiply by atomic or molecular mass
	- Mass of the other reactant or product
### Chapter 11.9
-  It Is not always necessary to Know the Chemical Equation to Carry out Stoichiometric Calculations
### Chapter 11.10
- When Two or More Substances React, the Mass of the product Is determined by the Limiting Reactant
### Chapter 11.11
- For Many Chemical Reactions the amount of the desired product obtained Is Less Than the Theoretical amount
	- The reaction my fail to complete
	- There may be side reactions with undesired products
	- Some desired products may not be recoverable or lost in purification
	- The original reactants may be impure or contaminated
- To find the limiting reactant divide the number of moles of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced chemical equation and the reactant with the least number of moles divided by its coefficient is the limiting reactant
- Percentage Yield = actual/ theoretical x 100
