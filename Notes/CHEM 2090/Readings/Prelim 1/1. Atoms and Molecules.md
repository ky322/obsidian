### Chapter 2.1
- Element: Substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances
- Compound: Substances that can be broken down into two or more elements
- Metals: Malleable (rolled or hammered into sheets) and ductile (drawn into wires)
- Molecule: A unit of two or more atoms joined together
- Diatomic Molecule: Molecules consisting of just two atoms
### Chapter 2.2
- Solid, Liquid, Gas
### Chapter 2.3
- Mixture: Component substances exists together without combining chemically
	- Heterogeneous: Not uniform from point to point
- Solution: Homogenous mixture of two or more components
	- Solute: Solid dissolved
	- Solvent: Liquid dissolved
- Aqueous Solution: Substance dissolved in water
- Fractional Distillation: Separation of two or more volatile components
### Chapter 2.4
 - Law of Constant Composition: The relative amount of each element in a particular compound is always the same
 - Mass percentage: $\frac{\text{mass of calcium}}{\text{mass of calcium sulfide}}\times 100$
 - Law of Multiple Proportions: Given element X and combine it with element Y to form two different compounds, X combines in a way such that for a fixed mass of X the ratio of the masses of Y in the two compounds consists of small numbers
### Chapter 2.5
- Atomic Theory
	1. Matter is composed of small indivisible particles called atoms
	2. The atoms of a given element all have the same mass and are identical in all respects
	3. The atoms of different elements diff in mass and chemical behavior
	4. Chemical compounds are composed of two or more atoms of different elements joined together. The particle that results when two or more atoms join together is called a molecule
	5. In a chemical reaction the atoms are rearranged, separated, or recombined to form new substances. No atoms are created, destroyed and the atoms are not changed
- Atomic Mass Ratio: ratio of the masses of a given atom to the mass of some particular reference atoms (carbon)
### Chapter 2.6
- Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions
### Chapter 2.7
- Binary Compounds
	- When a compound is made up of a metal and nonmetal we write the name of the metal then nonmetal with suffix -ide
- Ammonia $NH_3$, Methane $CH_4$
### Chapter 2.8
- Molecular Mass: Sum of atomic masses of atoms in a molecule
### Chapter 2.9
- An atom is composed of even smaller subatomic particles
- JJ Thomson: Electrons; cathode rays
- Rutherford: Radioactivity, alpha +2, beta -1 and gamma particles 0
	- Gold foil experiment; nuclear model of the atom
### Chapter 2.10
- Protons, neutron, electron
- Atomic Number: Number of protons in an atom
- Neutral Atom: Number of electrons equals number of protons
- Mass Number: Number of protons and neutrons in an atom
### Chapter 2.11
- Isotopes: Atoms of one element contains the same number of protons but different number of neutrons
- An isotope is denoted by the atomic number Z and mass number A ${Z}^{A}$X
- Ion: An atom or molecule that gains or loses one of more electrons becomes charged
- Atomic Mass is the sum of the masses of each isotope multiplied by its natural abundance for a weighted average
### Chapter 2.12
- Cations: Positively charged ions
- Anions: Negatively Charged ions; Given -ide suffix
