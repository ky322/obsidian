### Chapter 6.1
- Ionic Bond: Electrostatic force binds the ions together
- Octet Rule: Tendency of main group elements to form stable noble gas like ions with configuration $ns^2np^6$
- Metallic elements lose electrons to become positively charged ions cations
- Non Metallic elements gain electrons to become negatively charged ions anions
- Ionic compounds form extended crystal lattices of alternating ions
- Covalent compounds tend to exist as individual molecules
### Chapter 6.2
- Must balance charges
### Chapter 6.3
- 18 electron rule: Stability of $ns^{2}np^{6}nd^{10}$
### Chapter 6.4
- The ionic charge of transition metal ions with more than one common ionic charge is indicated by a roman numeral
- Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Au, Sn, Pb
### Chapter 6.5
- The Filling Order of most Transition metal Ions Is Regular
- 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 3d < 4s < 4p < 4d < 4f <
### Chapter 6.6
- Cations Are Smaller and Anions Are larger than their neutral parent atoms
### Chapter 6.7
- Coulomb's Law
- The net energy change for the reaction
	1. Electron is removed from the atom. Calculate the energy required to ionize
	2. The electron is removed is added to the other atom. Energy is released and called the electron affinity
	3. The ions are brought together using Coulomb's
