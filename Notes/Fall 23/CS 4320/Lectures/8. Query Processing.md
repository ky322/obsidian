### Buffer Manager
- Decides when to move data between disk and RAM
- Tries to reduce data movements using heuristics
- Buffer manager manages buffer pool
	- Buffer pool: Main memory reserved for DBMS
	- Divided into page-sized slots called frames
	- Stores meta-data about each slot
### Frame Properties
- Page ID
	- Page is currently stored in frame
	- Allows matching page requests to frames
- Pin Count
	- How many processes are using a page
	- Can only evict page if pin count reaches zero
- Dirty bit
	- In-memory page deviates from disk version
	- Must write page to disk before evicting it
### Processing Page Requests
- Case 1: Cache Hit (Requested page cached)
	- Increase pin count and return page address
- Case 2: Cache Miss (Requested page not cached)
	- Choose frame for replacement (replacement policy)
	- If frame contains dirty page then write it to disk
	- Read requested page from disk and store in frame
	- Increase pin count and return page address
### Why Not Rely on OS
- OS caches pages as well (virtual memory)
- Why do we want a separate buffer manager
	- DBMS knows its access patterns ahead of time
	- Can exploit for smarter replacements
	- DBMS must control page writes for safety guarantees
### LRU Replacement Policy
- Want to replace page required farthest in the future
	- Doing so reduces expensive cache misses
	- Difficult to predict 
- Heuristic: Remove least recently used page (LRU)
	- Did not use page for long time; unlikely to do soon
### Sequential Flooding
- DBMS has particular access patterns
	- Keep scanning pages in round robin mode
- Least recently used page is used again soonest making LRU policy highlight sub-optimal
### Query Processing
- Input query is parsed (parser) and simplified (rewriter)
- Query optimizer generates optimized execution plan
- Executing plan (executor) produces query result
### Query Plans
- Describes how to generate required data
- Typically represented as a tree
	- Leaf node represents a database table 
	- Inner node represents an operation
	- Tree edges represent data flow
### Operators
- Query plans use fixed set of standard operators
- Consumes relations and produces one relation
- Filter operator $\sigma$: Discard rows based on condition
- Projection operator $\pi$: Discard columns
- Join operator $\bowtie$: Find matching tuple pairs
### Relational Algebra
- Math foundations for describing query plans
- Represents query plan as math expression
