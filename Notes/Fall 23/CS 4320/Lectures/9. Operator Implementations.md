### Outlook
- How to implement standard operators
- Often have multiple implementations of same operator
- Can choose most efficient implementation at each point
- Cost estimation
	- Assumption: cost $\sim$ number of pages read/written
### Filter Operator $\sigma$
- Want to retrieve table rows satisfying a predicate
- Simplest Option: Scan all pages and check each entry
- If sorted we can use binary search for specific predicates
- Can use indexes if available (right table, right key)
### Costing Example
- Query: `SELECT * FROM Enrollment WHERE CID='CS4320'`
- Number of Students: 60000
- Number of enrollments/student: 10
- Size/Enrollment Entry: 10 Bytes
- Bytes/Page: 10000 Bytes
- Tree Height: 3
- Scan Cost
	- Number of Entries/Page: 100
	- Number of enrollment pages: 6000
	- Total Scan Cost: 6000
- Clustered Tree Index on CID
	- Number of Entries/Page: 100
	- Number of enrollment pages: 6000
	- Number of Inner Node Visits: 2
	- Number of Leaf Node Visits: 60
	- Total Scan Cost: 62
- Unclustered Tree Index on CID
	- Number of Entries/Page: 100
	- Number of enrollment pages: 6000
	- Number of Inner Node Visits: 2
	- Number of Leaf Node Visits: 60
	- Number of Data Pages Read: 6000
	- Total Scan Cost: 6062
### Insights
- Index or sort orders can speed up filtering but may not always be more efficient
- Query Optimizer: Need to calculate cost of alternatives and compare

### Join Operator $\bowtie$
- One of the most expensive operator; lots of research on different join operators
- Some are more generic and apply to any join predicate; some are faster; some need less memory
### Page Nested Loop Join
- Load one page after the other from first table
- For each page from first table:
	- Load one page after the other from the second table
	- For all tuples in memory: check and add to result
- First table = outer table
- `LoadPage (P) = Load page P`
- `Pages(T) = Pages of table T`
- `Tuples(P) = Tuples of page P
- $\bowtie$`E.Sid=S.Sid`
```
For ep ini Pages(E):
	LoadPage(ep)
	For sp in Pages(S):
		LoadPage(sp)
		For et in Tuples(ep), st in Tuples(sp):
		If (et.Sid=st.Sid):
			Output (et join st)
Cost = pages in E * load cost + 
	   pages in E * pages in S * load cost + 
	   tuples in E * tuples in S * evaluation cost
```
### How Much Memory
- Need space to store current page from outer table
- Need space to store current page from inner table
- Need one buffer page to store output before disk write
- Total: 3
### Improve the Join Operator
#### Block Nested Loop Join
- Page nested loop: Read inner table for each outer page
- Block nested loop: Read inner table for each outer block
	- More efficient as block contains multiple pages
- `PageBlocks(T,b): Blocks of b pages from T`
- `LoadPages(B): Load pages from block B`
- $\bowtie$`E.Sid=S.Sid
```
For ep in PageBlocks(E,b):
	LoadPages(ep)
	For sp in Pages(S):
		LoadPages(sp)
		For et in Tuples(ep), st in Tuples(sp):
			If (et.Sid=st.Sid):
				Output (et join st)
Cost = pages in E * load cost + 
	   blocks in E * pages in S * load cost
```
#### How Much Memory
- Need space to store blocks from outer relation: B
- Need space to store one page from inner relation: 1
- Need one page to store output before writing to disk: 1
#### Index Nested Loop Join
- Have index on join column and equality predicate
- Iterate over pages of non indexed (outer) table
- For each outer tuple, use index to find matching tuples
- `Index(Predicate): Entries satisfying`
- `Tuple(P,i): ith tuple on page P`
- $\bowtie$`E.Sid=S.Sid
```
For ep in Pages(E):
	LoadPage(ep)
	For et in Tuples(ep):
		For <sp, i> in Index(et.Sid=st.Sid):
			LoadPage(sp)
			Output(et join Tuples(sp,i))
Cost = pages in E * load cost + 
	   index entries * load cost
```
#### How Much Memory
- Need one page to store current page from outer table: 1
- Need one page to store current page from inner table: 1
- Need one page as output buffer before disk write: 1
### Alternatives for Equality Joins
- Two operators for equality join predicates
- Both pre-process input data to collocate rows with similar join column values with sorting or hashing
#### Hash Join
- Join Phase 1: Partition data by hash value in join columns
	- Read data and write partition data
	- Cost: 2(Number of Pages T1 + Number of Pages T2)`
	- Memory: 1 + Number of Buckets
- Join Phase 2: Join each partition pair (same hash value)
	- Read data and write result
	- Cost: (Number of Pages T1 + Number of Pages T2)
	- Memory: 2 + Number of Pages (Smaller Table) / Number of Buckets
- Number of Buckets = $\sqrt(\text{Number of Pages (Smaller Table)})$
##### What if We Lack Memory
- Number of buffer pages limits number of output buckets
- Not enough buckets means too much data per bucket
- Prevents us from loading one bucket entirely in Phase 2
- Perform multiple passes over data in Phase 1
- Iterate until data per buckets fits into main memory
#### Sort Merge
- Specific to equality join conditions
- Phase 1: Sort joined tables on the join column
	- Assume we access single entries
	- Random data access are inefficient so we want to access pages of entries so we want external sort algorithms
		- Step 1: Load chunk of data and sort, write back to disk
			- Assume we have $B$ buffer pages available
			- Load chunks of B pages into the buffer
			- For each chunk sort by standard sort algorithm
			- Write sorted data to hard disk 
			- Run: A sorted sequence of data
		- Step 2: Merge sorted runs to produce larger runs
			- Enables us to merge $B-1$ sorted runs into one in one step
				- Load first page of each sorted run into $B-1$ pages
				- Copy minimum entry in input buffers to output buffer
					- If output buffer full, write to disk and clear
				- Erase minimum entry from input buffer
					- If input buffer is empty, load next page
	- Cost
		- Multiple sorting passes, we read and write data once in each
			- Cost per pass: $2*\text{Number of Pages}$
			- How many steps for B buffer pages
				- First step: B, Second, B(B-1)
				- Stops after $1+ Ceil(\log_{B-1}\frac{N}{B})$ steps and when $(B-1)^{steps-1}B\geq N$
		- Each merging step reduces number of runs but longer
		- Finally have only one sorted run left
- Phase 2: Merge sorted tables together efficiently
	- Have sorted both input tables by their join column
	- Load first page of both sorted tables into memory
	- Find matching tuples and add to join result output
	- Load next page for table with smallest entry
	- Keep doing until no pages left for one table
	- Cost
		- Assume all duplicate entries on same page; duplicate if same value in join column
		- Each input page is only read once
		- Cost is proportional to number of input pages; Pages from both input tables
- Total Cost
	- Two input tables with M and N tuples, B buffer pages
	- Phase 1 Cost: $2*M*(1+Ceil(log_{B-1}\frac{M}{B}))$ for sorting table 1 and $2*N*(1+Ceil(log_{B-1}\frac{N}{B}))$ for sorting table 2
	- Phase 2: M + N
##### How Much Memory
- Phase 1: Try to exploit all buffer pages
	- More buffer means less merging passes
- Phase 2: Only exploit three buffer pages
	- One for first input, second input, and output
### Refined Sort Merge Join
- Merge more than two sorted tables in Phase 2
- Do not need to sort tables completely in Phase 1
- Save steps; passes over the data
- Phase 1: Only sort data chunks that fit into memory
- Phase 2: Join all sorted chunks together
- Assume B buffer pages tables with N and M pages
- Phase 1: Load chunks of B pages, sort, write back
	- Cost: $2(M+N)$
- Phase 2: Merge B-1 sorted chunks together
	- Cost: (M+N)
#### How Much Memory
- Assume B buffer pages input sizes are M and N
- Have $\frac{N+M}{B}$ sorted runs after Phase 1
- Need $B\geq1+(N+M)/B$ to merge them in one step
- If $N>M$ we need $B\geq2*\sqrt{N}$
### R-SMJ Versus Hash Join
- Time: 3 * Input Size for both
- Memory $2*\sqrt{\text{Larger Table Size}}$ vs $\sqrt{\text{Smaller Tabke Size}}$
- R-SMJ exploits order
