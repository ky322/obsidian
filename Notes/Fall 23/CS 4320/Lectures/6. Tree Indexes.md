### Quickly Finding Data
- Table `Enrollment(sid, cid)` links students to courses
	- Search entries for specific students
- Data stored as unordered file - must scan all pages
- Better: data sorted by student ID ; apply binary search
- Problem: Sometimes search for specific courses
- Only one sort order, cannot duplicate data
### Indexes
- Index: Auxiliary data structure for finding data faster
- Exactly same principle as for books
- Can have multiple indexes for same table
	- One index for finding info on specific students
#### How It Works
- Index stores references to data records
	- Store page IDs and slot IDs
- Index group records by values in specific columns
- Columns are the index search key
- Index retrieves records for specific search key values
- Binary search narrows down "search space" by factor 2
- Can we get a higher pruning factor per page read
-  Idea: Non binary search trees
### Index Node Content
-  Content of inner nodes:
	- $R(0), K(1), R(1), K(2), R(2)$
	- $R(i)$ leads to entries ordered before $K(i+1)$
	- $R(i)$ references an index page
- Content of leaf nodes:
	- $K(1), R(1), K(2), R(2), K(3), R(3)$
	- $R(i)$ leads to data entries with key $K(i)$
	- $R(i)$ references a data page and a slot on that page
### Where to Use Tree Indexes
- Can use index for queries with equality predicates
	- Example: `WHERE Sname = 'Alan'`
- Can use index for queries with inequality predicates
	- Example: `WHERE gpa > 3`
- Both cases work if predicate references index key
### Using Index for Equality
- Searching for entries with key value V -> Start at root node
- Until reaching a leaf node:
	- Search for $i$ such that $V\geq K(i), V<K(i+1)$
	- Follow associated reference $R(i)$
- At leaf node:
	- Search for $i$ such that $K(i)=V$
	- Retrieve data from $R(i)$ if found, otherwise return empty
### Linked Leaf Nodes
- Often want entries from neighboring leaf nodes
- Could get leaf node references from parent nodes
- Better: Store pointer to next/previous neighbor in leaf
- Leaf pages become doubly linked list
### Using Index for Inequalities
- Searching for index entries with key value from $[L,U]$
- Use equality search procedure to find entry with value $l$
- Follow links between leaf nodes until reaching value $U$
- Retrieve referenced data on the way
### Composite Keys
- Index search key may consist of multiple columns
- Must decide priority order between key columns
- Key comparisons use that priority order
	- Consider second column if same value in first
- Can use index for inequalities on prefix of key columns
### Indexes in Postgres
- `CREAT INDEX <index-name> on <table>(<columns>)`
	- Creates index for table using specified search key
	- Refer to index later with `<index-name>`
	- `<columns>` is comma separated column list (key)
- `DROP INDEX <index-name>`
	- Delete index with given name
### Which Indexes to Create
- Depends on your typical queries
- Analyze predicates of queries for index ideas
- Too many indexes can be bad for performance
### Concise Data Entries
- Many references for same search key value
	- Optimization: Store search key value with reference list
	- Advantage: Avoids storing key values redundantly
	- Disadvantage: Creates variable length field (list)
### Merging Index and Data
- Idea: Index stores data instead of references to data
	- Clustered Index
- Can have at most one clustered index per table
- More efficient as it saves chasing one reference
- Collocates data with same key
### Tree Index Variants
- B+ tree index is very popular
- Some tree indexes put data references in inner nodes
- Some omit the links between leaf nodes
- Differences in how updates are handled
### Handling Updates
- Index refers to database table
- If data changes the index changes
- Need to change index in case of inserts and deletes
- Ideally we want to keep index balanced during updates
	- Not required but can improve efficiency
### Problems
- Aforementioned approached used by ISAM index
- Okay for static data but problematic if dynamic
- Lots of overflow pages reduce performance
- Empty pages lead to space overheads
### B+ Trees
- One of the most popular index structures
	- Default in Postgres
- Balances tree after insert and delete operations
- Keeps the tree compact
	- Each node (except root) is at least half full
	- Number of entries between $d$ and $2d$ where $d$ is order
- B+ trees are shallow
	- Typical order is 100, typical fill factor $67\%$
	- Average fanout (number of child nodes) is 133
	- Second level can have $133^2=17689$ nodes
	- Third level can have $133^3=2352637$ nodes
### Updates with Balancing
- Typically expect even number of maximal entries
	- Maximal number of entries is $2^d$
	- Nodes are underfill with less than $d$ entries
- Have up to three entries per node in example
- Will consider nodes with one entry as underfill
### Options for Balancing
- After deletion need to fix nodes that are underfill
	- Have redistributed entries from sibling leaves
- Otherwise may have to merge tree node together
- Merge operations may propagate upwards in tree
	- Tree loses one level (inverse to insertion operation)
