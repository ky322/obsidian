SQL query $\rightarrow$ Query Optimizer $\rightarrow$ Query Plan
### Cost Model
- Data Statistics
	- Different DBMS collect different statistics
	- Number of distinct values in column; ratio of SQL null values in column
	- `VACUUM ANALYZE`: Force DBMS to create statistics
	- Generated statistics are exploited by query optimizer
	- Can access column statistics with `pg_stats` view
- Selectivity Model
	- Selectivity: Probability that row satisfies predicate
	- Estimate vis constraints and data statistics
	- Selectivity(Column=Value)=1/Number of Values
		- We assume uniform data
	- Number of Rows(Column=Value) $\leq1$ if key column
	- Selectivity(A^B)= Selectivity(A) * Selectivity(B)
		- We assume independent predicates
- Cardinality Model
	- Assume cardinality of single tables is given
		- DBMS stores that information for each base table
	- Calculate cardinality product for tables in from clause
		- If predicates are always true equals to the number of result rows
	- Multiply with selectivity estimates for all predicates
		- Estimate how many rows pass predicate filter
	- Estimate Page Size
		- Cost functions are based on number of data pages
		- Calculate average byte size per record for each result
		- Calculate how many records fit on one data page
		- Pages cannot store fractional records; round down
		- Divide number of rows by number of records per page
		- Result is size in pages
- Cost Model
	- Count cost of page reads and writes
	- Sum up cost over all operators in plan
	- For each operator consider for each input how often is it read from disk and for each output is it written to disk and is it the final result?
- Cost Estimate
### Cost Estimation Example
```
SELECT Count(*)
FROM Customers C JOIN Orders O USING (cid)
	JOIN Products P USING (pid)
WHERE C.location = 'Ithaca' AND P.name = 'Ithaca is Gorges'

Customers(Cid,name,location)
Orders(Cid, Pid, date)
Products(Pid, name, price)
```
#### Selectivity Estimation
| Element           | Property   | Value  |
|-------------------|------------|--------|
| Customers         | Cardinality| 10,000 |
| Orders            | Cardinality| 100,000|
| Products          | Cardinality| 5,000  |
| Customers.Location| # Values   | 100    |
| Products.Name     | # Values   | 2,500  |
`Foreign Key: Orders.Cid to Customers.Cid`
`Foreign Key: Orders.Pid to Customers.Pid`

| Predicate           | Selectivity |
|---------------------|-------------|
| ùõîC.Location='Ithaca' | 1/100       |
| C.Cid=O.Cid          | 1/10,000    |
| ùõîP.name='... Gorges' | 1/2,500     |
| O.Pid=P.Pid          | 1/5,000     |
#### Size Estimation
Assume page size of 8000 bytes, 4 bytes for integers and dates and 10 bytes for strings

| Table    | Columns                           | Size/Entry (bytes) | Rows/Page |
|----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Customers| Cid, name, location               | 24                 | 333       |
| Orders   | Cid, Pid, date                    | 12                 | 666       |
| Products | Pid, name, price                  | 18                 | 444       |
| C‚®ùO      | Cid, name, location, Pid, date    | 32                 | 250       |
| C‚®ùO‚®ùP    | Cid, C.name, location, Pid, date, P.name, price | 46 | 173       |
### Plan Enumeration
- Query Plan Space
- Decide order of operations and implementation
- Apply heuristic restrictions
	- H1: Apply predicates and projections early
		- Processing more data is more expensive
		- Want to reduce data size as quickly as possible
		- Can do that by adding predicates (discarding rows)
		- Can do that by adding projections (discarding columns)
	- H2: Avoid predicate-less joins
		- Join result size: Input cardinality * selectivity
		- Selectivity is one when joining tables without predicates
		- Very large join results, sub-optimal
		- Heuristic may discard optimal order in some cases
	- H3: Focus on left-deep plans
		- Allows pipelining: joins pass on result parts in-memory
		- Allows to use indices on join columns (of base tables)
- Generate every possible plan, estimate cost for each plan, select plan with minimal cost
	- Number of join orders can grow quickly O(nrTables!)
	- Number of join orders lower bounds number of plans
	- Enumerating plans is impractical
### Principle of Optimality 
- Want cheapest plan to join set of tables
- This plan joins table subsets on the way
- Assume we use sub optimal plan for joining table subset
- Replace by a better plan can only improve overall cost
### Efficient Optimization
- Find optimal plans for smaller sub queries first
- Sub-Query: Joins subsets of tables
- Compose optimal plans from optimal sub-query plans
- Time Complexity: $O(2^{\text{nrTables*...}})$
