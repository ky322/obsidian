### Projection $\pi$
- SELECT without DISTINCT
	- Calculate SELECT items, drop other columns
- SELECT with DISTINCT
	- Need to filter out duplicates
	- Can exploit hash function, exploit sorting, exploit index
#### Projection with Hashing
- Phase 1: Partition data into hash buckets
	- Scan input, calculate projection, partition by hash function
	- Data partitions are written back to hard disk
- Phase 2: Eliminate Duplicates for each partition
	- Read one partition into memory and eliminate duplicates
	- Can use second hash function to detect duplicates
- Constraint on memory similar for hash join
	- Count hash buckets for Phase 1 and bucket size for Phase 2
- Cost: 3 * Number of Pages
### Projection with Sorting
- Sorting rows can help find duplicates
- Use variant of external sort algorithm
	- Apply projection during first pass over data
	- Eliminate in-memory duplicates during all steps
	- Results in duplicate free and sorted
	- Reduce the number of passes with more main memory
- Cost is external sorting cost
### Projection with Index
- Assume index key includes projection columns
	- Can retrieve relevant data from index alone
	- Saves cost considering index smaller than data
- Tree index with projections as key prefix
	- Duplicates retrieve consecutively, easy to eliminate
- Cost: Reading index data
### Grouping $\Gamma$ and Aggregation $\Sigma$
- Aggregation without Grouping
	- Min, Max, Sum, Count, Average
	- Scan input data and update in memory aggregate
		- Can use constant memory, cost of reading input data once
	- Count distinct requires duplicate elimination
- Aggregation with Groups
	- Can use hashing; maintain hash table of group keys with aggregates
	- Sorting; sort on group keys, aggregate groups consecutively
	- Indexes; index key must contain group-by keys
### Set Operation $\cup,\cap,-$
- INTERSECT can be handled like a join; join condition is equality on all columns
- UNION eliminates duplicates
	- Hash and eliminate duplicates in each bucket
	- Sort and eliminate duplicates during merging
- R EXCEPT S
	- Partition with hash then treat each bucket separately
	- Sort and check whether R tuple in S during merge steps
### Query Plans
- Query plans describe query processing as tree
- Inner nodes are operators, leaf nodes are tables
- Logical query plan just specifies type of operations
- Physical query plan specifies implementation
### Passing Results Between Operators
- Each operator writes output to disk
- May lead to unnecessary read/write overheads
- Keep intermediate results in main memory; not always possible depending on size
- Physical plan specifies how results are passed on 
	- Pipelined operators passes result in memory to next operation
	- Label on the fly for unary operators means pipelined input
### Pipelined Nested Loop Joins
- Full join output may be too large to fit in memory
- Produce small join result parts consecutively
- Directly invoke next operator for result part in memory
- Chain nested loop joins; produce output with part of left input
### Plan Cost Estimation
- Calculate intermediate result sizes if not given
- Calculate cost of each operator; take into account how data is passed on
- Do not count output cost of final operator
	- Sum up cost of all operators in plan
