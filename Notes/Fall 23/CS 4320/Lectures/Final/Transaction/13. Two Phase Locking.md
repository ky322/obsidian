### Concurrency Control Protocols
- Desirable properties of schedules
	- Conflict serializability: Efficient and permissive
	- Want recoverable schedules, ACA or strict
- Protocols to enforce such schedules
	- Allowing more schedules: More optimization possible
	- Less schedules okay if mechanism more efficient
### Lock Based Concurrency
- Lock: Permission to operate on specific objects
	- Transactions need lock to work on object
	- Transactions obtain locks via lock request
	- May have to wait until desired lock is granted
- Lock Manager component grants locks
	- Keeps track of which transaction holds which locks
### Locking Strategy
- Use one lock for entire database
- Transactions request lock at transactions start and gives back lock at transaction end
- Only one transaction can hold at the same time
### Refining Lock Granularity
- Transactions can work on different objects in parallel
- Enable by locking specific database objects
- Locking protocol
	- Transaction request locks on all its objects at start
	- Waits until all locks have been granted
	- Transaction executes and releases locks at end
### Lock Types
- All conflicts involve some write operation
- Multiple transactions can read objects without conflict
- Distinguish between read and write locks
	- Read (shared) locks allow only read access
	- Write (exclusive) locks allow read and write access
- Transactions request either read or write lock
- Lock manager may grant multiple read locks on same object
#### Release Locks Early
- Transactions request locks at start and releases at end
- Releasing locks earlier may increase parallelism
	- Release lock after last operation on associated object
- May lead to cascading aborts
	- W1(A) Lock on A from 1 â†’ 2 R2(A) A1
### Acquire Locks Late
- Acquire locks directly before read or write operation
- May improve performance by increasing parallelism
- May lead to deadlocks
	- T1 acquires lock on A now waiting for B
	- T2 acquires lock on B now waiting for A
	- Transactions are both waiting for each other no progress
### Two Phase Locking
- Combines all optimizations
- Fine grained locks on single objects
- Distinguishes different lock types
- Locks may be acquired late or released early
- Restrictions on when locks are acquired and released
- Each transaction has two separate phases with 2PL
- First Phase: Transaction may acquire locks but no release
- Second Phase: Transaction may only release locks
	- Guarantees conflict serializable schedules
- Variants
	- Conservative 2PL: Acquire all locks at transaction start
		- Prevents deadlocks
	- Strict 2PL: Release all locks at transaction end
		- Prevents cascading aborts
	- Can be combined (Conservative Strict 2PL)
	- Plain 2PL makes no restrictions on locking periods
	- Being non conservative or non strict is more permissive
		- Allows more transactions to proceed in parallel
- 2PL only produces conflict serializable schedules
- Can 2PL produce all conflict serializable schedules? No
	- W1(A) R2(A) C2 R3(B) C3 W1(B) C1
	- Conflict graph has three nodes, two edges so no cycle
### Proof
- Assume schedule was generated using 2PL
- Imagine conflict graph of schedule
- Schedule is conflict serializable if it is acyclic
- Show cycle leads to contradiction
- Release First Lemma: If conflict graph has path from T1 to T2 then T1 releases some lock before T2 acquires some lock
