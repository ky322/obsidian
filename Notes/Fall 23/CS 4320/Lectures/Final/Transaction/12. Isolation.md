### Why Interleave Steps?
- Long running transactions
	- If a user submits a very short transaction they might have to wait if scheduled behind a long transaction
	- Alternate between transaction steps
	- Long transactions slower, short transaction quick
- Idle time by disk access
	- Assume transaction 1 needs data from disk for next step
	- Could load data while executing step from other transaction
### Isolation Anomalies
- Anomaly: May destroy illusion of sequential execution
- Dirty Reads: Read data from unfinished transaction
	- We read data written by uncommitted transaction
	- What if writing transaction aborts?
		- Need to undo all effects of aborted transaction
	- Strange effects even if writing transaction commits
	- Anomaly signature with short notation $Wx(A), Ry(A)$
- Unrepeatable reads: Data changes while working with it
	- Reading committed data may be problematic
	- We read data twice, changed from outside in between
	- Means we read different values without changing value
		- Check if there is at least one item stored (read 1), proceed
		- Other transaction reduces item count to zero
		- Now try to reduce item count by one (read 2 and write)
	- Anomaly signature: $Rx(A) Wy(A) Cy Rx(A)$
- Lost Updates: Unsaved changes are overridden
	- We override value written by ongoing transaction
	- Have two transactions updating salary to different values
	- Constraint holds if transactions execute sequentially but not if interleaving transactions
	- Anomaly signature: $Wx(A) Wy(A)$
- Phantom Problem
	- Read is unrepeatable because rows were inserted
	- Problem is not related to an update but to insertion

### Isolation in Postgres
### Concurrency Control
- Transactions -> Concurrency Control (Pick cheapest schedules among good ones) -> Schedule (Ordered Transaction Steps)
### Selecting Schedules
- Schedule: Ordered steps from multiple transactions
- A good schedule preserves the illusion of isolation
- Want to select cheapest schedule among the good ones
- Want to minimize selection overheads
- Need sufficient goodness criterion, quick to verify 
### Comparing Schedules
- Define good schedules by comparison with reference
	- Serial schedule (one transaction after the other)
- Introduce multiple equivalence schedule criteria next
	- Final state equivalence
		- Compare two schedules based on final database state
		- Equivalent schedules if DB content equal after execution
		- Must hold for arbitrary initial database content
		- W1(A) W2(A) W1(B) W2(B) C1 C2 = W1(A) W1(B) C1 W2(A) W2(B) C2
	- View equivalence
		- Stronger than final state equivalence
		- Two schedules S1 and S2 are view equivalent iff
			- If transaction X reads the initial value for some object in S1, it also does so in S2
			- If transaction X reads a value written by transaction Y in S1, it also does so in S2
			- If transaction X writes the final value written by transaction Y in S1, it also does so in S2
	- Conflict equivalence
		- Two operations of different transactions on the same object conflict if at least one of them is a write
			- No problem as long as transactions only read data
			- Conflict types: RW, WR, WW
		- Swapping conflicting operations changes results/view
		- Users do not notice swaps between nonconflicting operations
		- Condition for S1 and S2 being conflict equivalent: Can get from S1 to S2 by swapping nonconflicting operations
- Final State Serializability
	- Schedule S is final state serializable if there is a serial schedule that is final state equivalent to S
	- May have unrepeatable reads with final state serializability
		- Can be bad even if it does not influence database state
		- R1(A) W2(A) R1(A) is final state serializable
- View Serializability
	- Schedule is view serializable if view equivalent to a serial schedule
	- Verifying view serializability is NP-Hard; Too much overhead
	- Consider the schedule R1(A) W2(A) R1(A) C1 C2
		- R1(A) R1(A) C1 W2(A) C2: Not view equivalent as second read now returns initial value
		- W2(A) C2 R1(A) R1(A) C1: Not view equivalent as first read does not return initial value
- Serial (Slow Execution)$\in$ View Serializable (Slow concurrency control) $\in$ Final State Serializable (Anomalies)
- Conflict Serializability
	- Conflict Serializable: Conflict equivalent to serial schedule
	- Can test efficiently if schedule is conflict serializable
		- Draw conflict graph
		- Test is conflict graph has cycle
		- Conflict serializable if no cycle
### Conflict Graph
- Draw conflict graph for schedule to test serializablity
- Add one graph node for each transaction in schedule
- For each pair of conflicting operations O1 and O2 draw edge from O1 transaction to O2 transaction
- Semantics of having edge from node i to j
	- Any conflict equivalent schedule must order i before j
- Getting equivalent serial schedule for acyclic graph
	- Start with node (transaction) without incoming edges
	- Add all operations of that transaction and commit
	- Continue with node where all predecessors treated
### Handling Aborts
- Exclude aborted transactions for checking serializability
	- DBMS acts if aborted transactions never happened
- Orthogonal classification of schedules based on aborts
### Recoverable Schedules
- A schedule is recoverable if transaction commits only after all transactions it read from have committed as well
- Example of nonrecoverable schedule
	- W1(A) R2(A) W2(B) C2 A1
	- No trace of aborted transaction should remain
	- Write to B may have been influenced by read from A
### ACA Schedules
- Can make schedule recoverable by delaying commits
- May have chain of aborting transactions
	- Transactions read from aborted transaction - tainted
- Avoid Cascading Aborts Schedule: No transactions reads uncommitted data
- W1(A) R2(A) W2(B) C1 C2: Recoverable but is not ACA
### Strict Schedules
- No transaction reads or writes uncommitted data
- Otherwise cleanup after aborts get tricky
	- Need to keep track of different object versions
	- Must check for each object whether undo required
- W1(A) W2(A) W3(A) is not strict (ACA and Recoverable)
