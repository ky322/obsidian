### Database Transactions
-  A sequence of updates or queries that is connected
- DBMS commands for assigning queries to transactions
- DDMS makes certain guarantees about transactions
	- Example: Executes entire transaction or no part of it
### Transactions in Postgres
- `BEGIN;` Begin a transaction
- `COMMIT;` End a transaction
- Everything in between belongs to transaction
### ACID Guarantees
- Most RDBMS give ACID guarantees for transactions
- Atomicity: Execute all steps or nothing
	- Why would a transaction not fully execute?
		- System crash due to bug or power failure
		- Transaction step violates integrity constraints
		- Explicit transaction abort
	- Internally DBMS executes steps separately
		- May have to do cleanup in case of partial execution
- Consistency: Enforce all integrity constraints
	- Primary key constraints
	- Referential integrity (foreign key constraints)
	- DBMS will abort transactions threatening consistency
		- Careful differs from distributed systems consistency
- Isolation: Avoid interleaving transactions badly
	- Different users may execute transactions concurrently
	- Executing transactions sequentially is inefficient
		- Can overlap idle times with other transactions
	- DBMS may interleave steps from multiple transactions
	- Isolation means simulating sequential execution to users
- Durability: Ensure that updates are not lost
	- DBMS notifies users that transaction has committed
	- Durability guarantees that committed updates persist
	- This must hold even if DBMs or server crashes
	- Must store enough info on disk to restore at startup
	- Only notify user of commit after that has happened
