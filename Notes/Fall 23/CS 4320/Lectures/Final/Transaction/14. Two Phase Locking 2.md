### Handling Deadlocks
- Deadlocks can arise using non conservative 2PL
	- Deadlock: Transactions waiting in a circle
- Two ways for handling deadlocks
	- Detect and resolve deadlocks
	- Prevent deadlocks from happening
### Deadlock Detection
- Assume deadlock after timeout
- Maintain waits-for graph to detect deadlocks
	- One node for each transaction
	- Edge from T1 to T2 if T1 waits for lock held by T2
	- Edges are added as lock requests come in
	- Cycle in waits-for graph indicates deadlock
### Resolving Deadlocks
- Abort one deadlocked transaction
- Aborted transaction is usually restarted
- Cam try to optimize selection of aborted transaction
	- Example: Abort youngest transaction for least overhead
### Avoiding Deadlocks
- Proactively abort transactions that may cause deadlocks
- Priority based on timestamps (older transactions have higher priority)
- Wound-wait protocol
	- T1 needs lock held by T2
	- T1 causes T2 abort if T1 has higher priority
	- T1 waits for lock from T2 if T1 has lower priority
- Wait-die protocol
	- T1 waits for lock from T2 if T1 has higher priority
	- T1 aborts itself if it has lower priority than T2
### Wound Wait Deadlock Prevention Proof
- A deadlock means transaction wait in a cycle
- Only lower priority transactions can wait for higher priority
- Assume cycle in waits-for graph T1 in cycle
	- T1-> T2: T1 must have lower priority than T2
	- T1->T2->T3: T1 must have lower priority than T3
	- T1->...->T1: T1 must have lower priority than T1
- Leads to contradiction so no cycle is possible
### Wait Die Deadlock Prevention Proof
- Only higher priority transaction can wait for lower priority
- Assume cycle in waits-for graph T1 in cycle
	- T1-> T2: T1 must have higher priority than T2
	- T1->T2->T3: T1 must have higher priority than T3
	- T1->...->T1: T1 must have higher priority than T1
- Leads to contradiction so no cycle is possible
### Wound Wait Vs Wait Die
- Wait Die
	- Transaction that acquired all locks will not abort but young transactions may re abort for same reason
### Avoiding Starvation
- Higher priority transaction is never restarted for both
- When restarting transaction assign original timestamp
- Transaction will eventually prioritized to avoid starvation (no transaction never processed)
### Avoid Phantoms
- Predicate Locking: Lock tuples satisfying certain predicates
	- Lock current and future entries equally
	- Complex to realize for arbitrary predicates
- Can use index when considering equality predicates
	- Lock index page that would change at insertion
	- Cannot insert as long as index page is locked
### Locking in Tree Indexes
- We traverse tree in one direction only
- Locking one node sufficient to block other transactions
	- Keeping later transaction out of current subtree
- Locking for index lookups (crabbing)
	- Identify next node (child node or root at start)
	- Lock next (read lock) then unlock parent and repeat
#### Updates
- Index updates change index leaf nodes and may propagate up
- Updates may not propagate upwards of safe nodes
	- Safe node is less than full insertions and more than half full deletions
- When traversing tree release prior locks at each safe node
- May pessimistically request write locks but reduces performance
- Can optimistically request read locks for all nodes except leaf
	- Bets on no propagation may have to restart if we lose
### Multiple Granularity Locks
- Fine grained locking can increase degree of parallelism
- Can increase locking overheads
- Best granularity may depend on query
	- Like whether we access most or few table rows
- Multiple granularity locking mixes lock granularities
	- Have locks for entire table and locks for single rows
- Challenge: Granting locks of diverse granularity consistently
- Cannot treat locks at different granularity differently
	- May grant conflicting locks otherwise
- Need locks on containing objects before locking object
- Intention Locks
	- IS (Intention shared)
		- Want shared lock on contained object
	- IX (Intention Exclusive)
		- Want exclusive lock on contained object
	- Need IS lock on ancestors before requesting shared lock
	- Need IX lock on ancestors before exclusive lock
	- Release intention locks from leaf to root node
		- Otherwise may have inconsistent locks
