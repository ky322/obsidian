### Optimistic Concurrency
- Locking itself leads to overheads
	- Overheads due to lock management or deadlocks
- Locking prevents conflicts proactively
	- Pessimistic assumption: conflicts are likely
	- Optimistic concurrency control
		- Conflicts are rare no need to avoid proactively
#### Bookkeeping
- Need to keep read set and write set for each transaction
	- Read set: Objects that the transaction read
	- Write set: Objects that the transaction wrote
#### Execution Phases
- Read
	- Read relevant data from database
	- Execute transaction on private copy
- Validate
	- Check for conflicts with other transactions
- Write
	- Publish local changes if no conflicts
#### Validation Phase
- Assign transactions to unique timestamps at validation
	- Will try to serialize transactions in timestamp order
- Two transactions cannot have conflicted if
	- T1 completes before T2
	- T1 completes before T2 starts writing, W(T1) disjunct with R(T2)
	- T1 completes read before T2 completes reads T(T1) disjunct with R(T2) and W(T2)
#### Combine Validation and Write Phase
- Only one transaction can be in validation and write phase
- Only need to consider conflict cases 1 and 2
	- Write phases cannot overlap
### Optimistic Concurrency Control Overheads
- Must record read and write sets
- Transaction restarts if validation fails
- Critical section during validation and writes
- Good if probability of conflicts if low
### Timestamp Concurrency Control 
- Associate transactions with timestamps
- Want to serialize transactions in timestamp order
- Associate each object with timestamps
	- Read timestamp: Time of last read
	- Write timestamp: Time of last write
- T wants to read database object A
	- Abort and restart if TS(T) < WTS(A)
- T wants to write database object A
	- Abort and restart if TS(T) < RTS(A)
- Restarting overheads for aborted transactions
- Need to keep track of object timestamps
	- Means space consumption increases
	- Overheads for updating timestamps
		- Requires write for each operation
#### Thomas Write Rule
- T wants to write A but TS(T) < WTS(A)
- Conflicts with serialization order could abort
- Thomas write rule ignores outdated writes instead
	- R1(A) W2(A) C2 W1(A) C1 simplifies to R1(A) C2 W1(A) C1
	- Not conflict serializable but view serializable
### Multi Version Concurrency Control
- Keep multiple versions of database objects
- Helps for instances like R1(A) W1(A) R2(A) W2(B) R1(B) W1(C)
	- Not conflict serializable as written
	- Could fix by moving R1(B) before W2(B)
	- Making R1(B) read old version of B has same effect
- Each transaction receives timestamp when entering
	- Will try to serialize transactions in this order
- Each write creates a new version of an object
	- Perform write check and abort if not valid
	- Version has timestamp of writing transaction
- Read mapped to last version before transaction timestamp
	- Transaction with timestamp i reads version with largest timestamp k such that k< i
### Write Check
- Want to be consistent with transaction timestamps
- Can transaction with timestamp I write object A
	- Assume transaction with timestamp > I
	- cannot read earlier version of A than I
	- Must abort if this has already happened
		- Track read timestamps for versions
- Guarantees serializability
- Need additional mechanisms for abort properties
	- Delay commits for recoverability
### Snapshot Isolation
- Each transaction operates on database snapshot
- This snapshot is taken once transaction starts
	- Uses last committed value for each object
- Maintains multiple object versions internally
	- Different from MVCC: No uncommitted values
### Handling Writes
- Check before commit for overlapping writes
- Everything okay if target objects unchanged, otherwise abort and restart transaction
