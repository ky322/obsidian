### Schema Normalization
- Prepare first sketch of database schema via ER
- Resulting schema is sub optimal
	- The schema implies lots of data redundancy
	- Data redundancy leads to various problems
- Optimize initial schema via schema normalization
### Roadmap
- Functional Dependencies: Indicate redundancy
	- Used to detect data redundancies (want to remove)
	- Values in some columns uniquely decide values in others $X\rightarrow Y$
	- Remove redundancy by decomposing table
	- FD Does not connect columns in same table
	- Prior anomalies cannot happen anymore
	- Must avoid data loss via decomposition
- Normal Forms: Desirable formal schema properties
	- Boyce-Codd Normal Form
- Normalization Algorithms: Transform to normal form
	- Decomposition
### Functional Dependencies
- Values in X determine values in Y
- Redundant storage of Y if X stored multiple times
	- Sufficient to store Y once for each X value
- Want to design schema to avoid this in each case
	- Consider all possible future database states
- Want to avoid storing X and Y in the same table
#### Finding FD
- Common mistake: Finding FD by looking at data
	- Data only captures current state of database
- Not all functional dependencies may appear
- Domain knowledge
- Inferring new FDs from given FDs F1|=F2
	- No relation can satisfy F1 without satisfying F2
- Can infer all FD by Armstrong's Axioms
	- Reflexivity: If $Y\subseteq X$ then $X\implies Y$
	- Augmentation: If $X\implies Y$ then $XZ\implies YZ$
	- Transitivity: If $X\implies Y$ and $Y\implies Z$ then $X\implies Z$
- Closure of a set of FDs are all implies FDs
- $F+=\{f|F|=f\}$
- F is a cover for G if $F+=G+$
### Attribute Closure
- Entire closure is too large to be useful
- Attribute closure gets all FDs for fixed left attributes
	- X+ for attributes X is attribute closure
- Useful for checking if one specific FD is implies
- Goal: Get attribute closure of X given FDs F
- Repeat until no change
	- Start with closure X
	- Iterate over all FDs $A\implies B\in F$
		- If closure $\subseteq A$ then add B to closure
- Complexity: O(#FDs^2*# Attributes)
### Finding all Relation Keys
```
Iterate over all attributes set A
	Check if A is a key
		Calculate attribute closure A+
		It is a key if A+ includes all attributes
```
### Boyce-Codd Normal Form BCNF
- A schema is in BCNF if all
	- For all BDs $A\implies b$ whose attributes are in the same table
		- Either b is element in A
		- Or A contains a key of its associated table
		- Or b is a part of some minimal key for 3NF
	- Must apply to given and inferred FDs
- Does not permit any redundancy
### Comparison of Normal Forms
- BCNDF does not allow redundancy
	- Pros: Avoid negative effects of redundancy
	- Con: May require breaking up dependencies like verifying FD may require joins
- 3NF allows redundancy in some cases
	- Pro: Can always preserve dependencies
	- Con: May have some negative effects
### Decomposition
- Normal form impose conditions on FDs in single table
- Decompose tables into smaller tables to satisfy them
- Decomposition must allow to reconstruct original data
- Assume we decompose R into X and Y
	- We can do so if $X\cap Y\implies X$ or $X\cap Y\implies Y$ is an FD
### Towards BCNF
- Repeat while FD $A\implies b$ on R violates BCNF rules
	- Decompose R into R-b and Ab
- All decompositions are lossless as $(R-b)\cap Ab=A\implies b$
- Will terminate as tables get smaller
- End result may depend on decomposition order
- Example: CSJDPQV, key C, JP→C, SD→P, J→S
	- For SD→P, decompose into SDP, CSJDQV  
	- For J→S, decomposes CSJDQV into JS, CJDQV  
	- Final database schema: SDP, JS, CJDQV
#### 3NF
- If dependency A-> b broken then add relation Ab
- Want to use minimal cover FDs for this
	- Right hand side of each FD is a single attribute
	- Closure changes when deleting any FD or any attribute
### Dependency Preservation
- Assume we decompose R into X and Y
- Assume we enforce FDs on X and Y separately
	- We enforce all FDs that only use attributes on X
	- Then we enforce all FDs that only use attributes on Y
- This enforces all FDs on R if dependency preserving
### Decomposition Properties
- Lossless vs dependency preserving
- None of the two properties implies the other
- BCNF may lose dependency preservation
- 3NF fixes that
