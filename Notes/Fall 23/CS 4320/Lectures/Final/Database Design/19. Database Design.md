### Database Design Process
- Requirement Analysis
	- Based on use cases, business process descriptions
- Conceptual Design
	- Model what the database is about via ER diagrams
- Schema Normalization
	- Reduce data redundancy via transformation
- Physical Tuning
	- Decide which indices to create or sort order
### Entities and Attributes
- Entity set: Multiple entities of the same type
	- Represented as a rectangle in ER diagram
- Attribute: A property connected to an entity set
	- Represented as an oval in ER diagram
	- Connected via lines to associated entity
	- Underlined if (part of) a key attribute
	- Attribute have simple values (integer)
### Relationships
- Relationships connects entities
- Represented as diamonds
- Connecting lines indicate targeted entities and may connect two or more entities
#### Classifying Relationships
- Can constrain number of relationships per entity
- Participation constraint: Entity must relate at least once 
	- Represented by thick line (entity to relationship)
- At-most-one constraint: Entity relates to at most once
	- Represented by arrow (from entity to relationship)
#### Features
- Can associate relationships with attributes
	- Same representation as for entity attributes and refers to related entity combinations
- Can assign entities to roles
### Sub Classes
- Sub-classing allows to reduce redundancy in diagram
	- Sub-classes inherit the attribute and relationship from parent
- Represent sub-classes via triangles (Is-A)
	- No multiple inheritance (sub-classes form tree)
### Weak Entities
- Can only be uniquely identified by considering the primary key of another (owner) entity
- Connects to owner via identifying relationship
- Each weak entity must participate in identifying relationship at most once
### Aggregation
- Models relationship of a relationship
- Surround relationship with dashed rectangle and connect with other items
### Entities vs Attributes
- Choose between entities and attributes
	- Model address as attribute or connected entity
- Use entity if employees can have multiple addresses
- Attribute values cannot be set valued
- Model as entity if we want to structure address further
- Model components as attributes
### ER Diagrams as Relations
- Translate ER diagrams to relations
- Each entity becomes a row in relation
- Properties are represented as columns
- Underlined attributes part of primary key
### Translating Relationships
- Introduce relation capturing relationships
- Columns store primary keys of all connected entities
- Rows represent relationship between specific entities
- Primary key combines primary keys of entities
- Additional attributes become columns
### Translating Subclasses
- Entities of subclass may have additional attributes
- Separate relations for superclass and subclass
- Introduce multiple relations linking key to attributes
- Use relation for subclass, set unused attribute to null
### Translating Weak Entities
- New relation for storing weak entities
- Add foreign key columns referencing owner entity
