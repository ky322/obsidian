- Consistency: Database satisfies all constraints
- Now means all replicas appear in sync
### Eventual Consistency
- Traditional DBMS choose consistency over availability
	- Not idea in online shopping
	- Want to be available at all cost
- Need to accept inconsistency according to CAP
- Inconsistency is resolved eventually

### BASE Transactions
- BASE: Basically Available Soft state Eventually consistent
### NoSQL
- Systems that move away from traditional SQL DBMS
- Reduced consistency (BASE)
- Non-SQL query languages
- Non-relational data models
### Apache Cassandra
- Distributed system, every node has the same role
- Wide column store ~ rows have different columns
- Supports CGL, simpler than SQL (no joins)
- Supports replication for fault tolerance
- Goal: Scale linearly when adding new nodes
- Eventually consistent with tunable consistency
#### Eventual Consistency
- Nodes periodically exchange information on updates
- Each node communicates with a limited number of peers
- Eventually updates are propagated to all nodes
#### Tuning Consistency
- Cassandra allows to tune several parameters
	- Replication factor: N
	- Number of replicas for successful read: R
	- Number of replicas for successful write: W
#### Condition for Consistency
- Strong consistency if $R+W>N$
	- If so we read at least one updated replica
	- Use time stamps to identify most recent version
### Amazon Dynamo
- Eventually consistent data storage system
- "Always writeable" or sales are lost
- Customized conflict resolution strategies
#### Writing Data
- Updates should always be possible and fast
- Only require updating few replicas for update to return
- Means we may have temporarily inconsistent data
#### Reading Data
- We may have temporarily inconsistent data
- Reading multiple replicas may return multiple versions
- Try to identify and discard outdated versions
- For others: Apply customized reconciliation strategy
#### Identifying Outdated Versions
- We associated each object version with a vector clock
- A vector clock stores one counter for each node
- Node counter increases monotonically for updates
- Each node updates its counter along with an object
- Tracks which version was generated from which version
#### Consistency Guarantees
- Strong consistency: Reads after update return new version
- Weak consistency: Reads may return outdated value
	- Eventual consistency: Specializes weak consistency
- Read-your-writes consistency: Process reads its updates
	- Session consistency: Read-your-writes within session
- Monotonic read consistency: Process never sees older value than seen before
### CAP Criticism
- Focuses on an extreme cases: Full partitions are rare
- Simplifies tension between conflicting design goals
	- Can decide A vs C for single transactions
	- Consistency is not a binary property
### NewSQL
- Traditional SQL: ACID at the expense of performance
- NoSQL: Give up ACID for higher performance
- NewSQL: New ideas for ACID with high performance
### H-Store
- Modern transaction workloads
	- Short running transactions
	- No user input needed
	- Transactions ~ template
- Modern Hardware
	- Main memory often fits entire DB
	- Distributed systems common
### Summary
- ACID transaction favors consistency
- BASE transactions favors availability
- Both in tension to each other (CAP)
- NewSQL systems exploits new ideas to get both
