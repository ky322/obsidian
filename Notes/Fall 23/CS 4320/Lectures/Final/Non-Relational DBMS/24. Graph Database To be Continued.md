### Graph Data
- A set of nodes and a set of edges connecting nodes
- Nodes and edges can be associated with labels and properties
- Storing graph data in relational DBMS is possible
- Querying graphs with vanilla SQL is inconvenient
- May increase efficiency by graph specialization
### Cypher
- Graph query languages used by Neo4j
- Allows creating and updating nodes and relationships
- Allows searching graphs for complex patterns
- Aggregation, filtering and sub queries
### Creating Nodes
- Create(): Create node without labels or properties
- CREATE(:Student): Create node labeled as student, no properties
- CREATE(:Student{name: 'Marc'}): Create node labeled as student, name set to 'Marc'
### Finding Nodes
- MATCH(m:Student {name: 'Marc'})
	- Find nodes labeled as "Student"
	- Name property must be set to "Marc"
	- Match result is assigned to variable m
	- Variable m can be used in remaining query
