### Updating Transaction Table
- Transaction updates data: Update transaction `lastLSN` 
- Transaction commits: Update transaction status to committed  
- Transaction aborts: Update transaction status to aborted  
- Transaction ends: Remove from transaction table
### Updating Dirty Table
- Page Changed: If page not in table add page with current LSN as `recLSN`  
- Page Written to Disk: Remove page if in table
### Updating `PageLSN`
- Data update: Update `PageLSN` in memory  
- Page Written to Disk: `PageLSN` is copied to disk
### Updating Log Tail Buffer
- Transaction updates data: Write update log entry
- Transaction commits: Write commit log entry
- Transaction aborts: Write abort log entry
- Undo transaction update: Write compensation log record
- Finished transaction cleanup: Write end log record
### Updating Log on Disk
- Transaction commits: Before commit: Flush log entries  
up to last transaction entry  
- Page written to disk: Before writing: Flush log entries  
until last entry affecting page `(pageLSN)`
### Updating `FlushedLSN`
- Log written to hard disk until LSN X: Update `FlushedLSN` to X
### Recovery Phase
- Analysis phase: Read log to restore transaction and dirty page tables
- Redo Phase: Redo non-persisted changes of all transactions
- Undo Phase: Undo changes of aborted transactions
### Analysis Refinement: Checkpoints
- Restore transaction and dirty page table during analysis
	- Without refinements we would have to read entire log
- Checkpoints save time during analysis hase
	- Checkpoint captures transaction and dirty page table state
	- Checkpoint written to log
	- Master stores LSN of last checkpoint
### Writing Checkpoints
- Want to write checkpoints without stopping transactions
- Log `Begin Checkpoint` at checkpoint start
- Start writing Transaction and dirty page table to log
- Log `End Checkpoint` once down
- Logged tables represent state at checkpoint start
### Analysis Phase 1
- Initialize transaction and dirty page table to last checkpoint
- Scan log forward starting from `Begin Checkpoint`
- LSN Lx: Transaction Ty updates page Pz
	- If Pz not in Dirty Page table add with recLSN=Lx
	- If Ty not in transaction table add as running
	- Set lastLSN=Lx in transaction table
### Analysis Phase 2
- LSN Lx: Transaction Ty commits
	- Mark Ty as committed in transaction table
- LSN Lx: Transaction Ty aborts
	- Mark Ty as aborted in transaction table
- LSN Lx: End record for transaction Ty
	- Remove Ty from transaction table
### Redo Phase
- Start scanning log from earliest recLSN in DP table
	- First log entry that made some page dirty
- Focus on data updates and compensation log records
	- Redo change update pageLSN (No new log entry)
### Avoid Redo Operations
- We can avoid a redo if one of these conditions hold
	1. Page affected by the update is not in the dirty page table
	2. Affected page is in dirty page table but recLSN>LSN
	3. PageLSN of page on hard disk with pageLSN $\geq$LSN
### Undo Phase
- Undo changes by transactions running at crash
- Undo changes in reverse log order
	- Follow prevLSN pointers backwards in log
	- Write compensation log records while undoing
### Crash During Recovery
- ARIES Can deal with failures during any recovery phase
- Crash during analysis: Restart analysis
- Crash during redo: Restart analysis and redo
	- May not have to redo everything if changes persisted
- Crash during undo: Restart all phases
	- CLRs are redone but never undone
