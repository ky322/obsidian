### Measuring Biodiversity
- Species Diversity
	- Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species
- Genetic Diversity
- Ecosystem Diversity
- Species Richness: Number of species in an area species area curve
- Relative Abundance: Relative number of species
- Taxonomic Diversity: Taxonomic relationship among species
- Generally see greater diversity in equatorial latitudes, decline towards poles, increase with sunlight, decrease with elevation
- In aquatic ecosystems, greater diversity with depth, down to 2000 meters then decline
- Keystone species are critical
### Type of Species
- The most species rich environments: tropical rainforests, coral reefs, the deep sea, large tropical lakes
	- Tend to have high species richness but low abundance
- Types of species in an area: native species, non native species, keystone species, indicator species
### Keystone Species
- Play a pivotal role in structure and function of an ecosystem
- Interaction with other species effect health and survival of these species
- Process materials out of proportion to numbers or biomass
- Specific pollinators of flowering plant species: bees, hummingbirds
- Predation by carnivores keeps population in check
- Recycling of nutrients: Dung beetle recycling animal waste
- Habitat modification: Elephants uproot trees and open up grassland or beaver dams
### Indicator Species
- Early warning of damage to an ecosystem
- Birds tend to respond quickly to change
- Decline in songbird population indicative of habitat loss
- Decline in trout species, amphibians indicative of water pollution
### Ecosystem Structure
- Ecosystems: All of the organisms in a particular place and the environment with which they interact
- Very complex systems difficult to predict how ecosystems will change with changes in environment and interactions with human activity
- Communities: The different population of species found in ecosystem
### Ecosystem Energetics
- Flow of energy is the most basic interaction between organisms in an ecosystem
- Energy Flows: From non living environment through living organisms and eventually lost as heat to the environment
- Autotrophs capture energy from the non living environment: Chemosynthesis and photosynthesis
- Autotrophs in turn provide food for heterotrophs
- Trophic Level: The basic unit for energy flow
	- 1st Trophic Level: Producers (autotrophs)
	- 2nd Trophic Level: Primary consumers (Herbivores)
	- 3rd Trophic Level: Secondary consumers 
	- The collection of trophic levels makes a food chain or food web
- Most ecosystems can support 4-6 trophic levels
- Energy loss is significant in each transfer
- Plants capture about 1% of sunlight for photosynthesis
- Each tropic level assimilates 10% of the energy available from the previous level
- In most cases biomass of each level is at most 10% of the previous level
- Decomposers: Recycle nutrients and organic material; Nutrient cycles and carbon cycle
- Parasites: Live in or on other individuals and cause harm
### Succession
- Succession: Ecosystems change over time
- Gradual change in species composition in a given area
- Pioneer Species: 1st to move in and colonize
- Climax Community: Most stable
- Secondary Succession: Follows a disturbance
### Species Interactions
- Competition: When resources are limited
- Mutualism: Both organisms benefit
	- Mycorrhizae, flowers and pollinators, plants and seeds and fruit dispersers
