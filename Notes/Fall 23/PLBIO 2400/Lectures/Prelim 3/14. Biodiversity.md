### Loss of Biodiversity
- Global Extinction Rate is estimated to be 10-10000 times higher than it was before human existence
	- 2 - 200 species per day become extinct
- 34% of Fish species, 25% of amphibians, 24% of mammals, 20% of reptiles, 14% of plant species face premature extinction
	- In the USA 33% of plant and animal species are vulnerable to extinction
### Human Factors Relating to Decreased Biodiversity
- Habitat Loss and degradation
- Invasive species
- Hunting, poaching, overfishing
- Sale of exotic species (animal and plants)
- Pollution
- Climate Change
### Effect of Human Activity on Biodiversity
- 40-50% of Earth's surface have been taken over, disturbed or degraded
	- Conversion of forests and grasslands to crop fields or urban areas, filling in wetlands
- Global forest cover have been reduced 20-50%
- Half of all wetlands have been lost in the last century
### United States
- 90-95% of virgin forests have been cleared since 1620
- 98% of tallgrass prairie cleared in the Midwest USA
- 99% of grassland, 91% of wetlands, 85% of Redwood forests in California are gone
### Passenger Pigeon
- Population estimated to be as high as 5 billion birds in the early 1800s
- Hunting became popular in the 1850s advanced with the development of the telegraph and railroads in the 1870s
- Population down to a few thousands by the 1880s; last known wild pigeon killed in 1900 and last pigeon in captivity died in 1914
### Value of Biodiversity 
- Instrumental value: Human centered
- Utilitarian uses/ non utilitarian uses
- Intrinsic Value: Inherent value unrelated to humans
- Utilitarian Uses
	- Economic Goods: Food, fuel, fiber, lumber, medicine
	- 90% of food crops were domesticated wild tropical plants
	- 40% of medicine, 80% of the top 150 prescription drugs in the USA derived from living organisms, 74% from tropical plants from developing countries
	- 85% of antibiotics are fungal derivatives, Only 2% of known fungi have been evaluated.
	- Only 3% of plant species have been examined for useful drugs
	- Ecological Services: The flow of cycling of materials and energy in the biosphere
	- Photosynthesis
	- Pollination of crops and other plants
	- Soil formation and maintenance
	- Nutrient recycling
	- Absorption and detoxification of pollutants in air and water
	- Information: Genetic and educational information or scientific information from studies
	- Recreation: Eco-tourism
	- Americans spend 3 times more to watch wildlife than movies or professional sports
	- A male lion living to age 7 in Kenya generates $515,000 in tourism revenue but $1000 if killed for its hide
- Non Utilitarian Uses
	- We find value in its existence, aesthetic beauty
- Intrinsic Value of Biodiversity
	- Each species has an inherent value and right to exist
