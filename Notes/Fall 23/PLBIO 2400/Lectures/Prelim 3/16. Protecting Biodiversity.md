### Protecting Biodiversity
- Legal aspects
- Do we have a responsibility to protect and control nature?
- Who owns nature?
- Do we have a right to exploit natural resources at the expense of diversity
- Tragedy of the commons
### Domestic Laws to Protect Wildlife
- Lacey Act of 1900: Prohibits the transport of live or dead wild animals across state borders without a permit
- Endangered Species Preservation Act 1966
- Endangered Species Act 1973
### Endangered Species Act
- Threatened and endangered species identified by US Fish and Wildlife, National Marine Fisheries Service
- Species can not be hunted, injured, collected or killed in the US
- Decisions based on biology only though economic considerations taken into account when deciding recovery plans
- Between 1973 and 2012 the number of species increased from 92-2052; Nearly doubled in the last 10 years 40% plants and 60% animals
- Estimated 30,000 species are in danger
- Critical habitats and recovery plans established by the department of Interior-1143 implemented as of 2012
- USFWS and NMFS come up with recovery plans-75% of species have recovery
- 1982 Interior can establish Habitat Conservation Plans: Landowners can destroy some critical habitat or kill endangered species in exchange for taking protective steps
- Relocation of species set aside preserves pav government to buy habitat elsewhere
### Weakness
- Evasive techniques can be used by landowners; land can be managed to reduce use by endangered species like planting crops, plowing fields, deforestation
- No timetable for establishment of recovery plans
- Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) binds signatory nations to reverse global decline in biodiversity
- Sets guidelines for compensation regulation of bioprospecting
### Wildlife Management
- Regulation of fishing and hunting to manage populations
- Manipulation of vegetation and water supplies
### Sanctuary Approach
- National Wildlife Refuge System: 524 refuges in the USA 20% of endangered species and their habitats
- Potential use for abandoned military bases
- Zoos, parks, seed banks, gene banks
	- 50 seed banks store 100 plant species that make up 90% of food supply
	- 1600 botanical gardens 30% of plant species
#### Zoos and Aquariums
- Captive breeding programs: Intention to re-release into the wild need 100-500 individuals for genetic variability
- Artificial insemination and cloning
- Space for only half of threatened vertebrate species in the world
### Managing Land in USA
- 42% of land is public: 73% in Alaska, 22% in Western states
- 20% of oil reserves, 30% natural gas reserves, 40% coal reserve, 40% commercial forests
- National Forests: Multiple use land
- Wildlife refuges: Moderately restricted
- National Parks: Restricted Use land
### Ecological Succession
- Gradual change in species composition in a given area
- Pioneer species: 1st to move in and colonize
- Climax Community: Most stable
- Secondary Succession: Follows a disturbance
- Succession must be managed to maintain a particular habitat
- Planting seeds, transplanting, controlled burning all used
### Managing Goals
- Maintain native ecosystems
- Sustain native species while controlling invasive species
- Sustain ecological processes: succession, natural cycles
- Maintain evolutionary potential of species and ecosystems
- Allow sustainable human use of resources in ways that do not harm long term sustainability
### Designing Nature Preserves
- Ecosystems are rarely stable
- Moderate disturbance leads to greatest diversity
- Prevention Strategy: Reduce future loss by preserving species rich areas internationally
- Emergency Action: Identify hot spots diverse areas in danger of habitat loss 1.4% of land area but 60% of terrestrial
### Biodiversity Hotspots
- Shape: Circular is ideal; Interior is buffered and depends on available land
- Size: One large vs several small
- Heterogeneity allows for movement and managing disturbance
- Buffer zone: Allow some resource extraction
- Adaptive Ecological Management: Integrate ecological, social, and economic principles to maintain and restore while supporting community and local economies
### Ecological Restoration
- Restoration or replacement
- Identifying causes of damage: Pollution, overgrazing, invasive species
- Mimic nature whenever possible
- Recreate niches that have been lost
- Rely on pioneer species, succession
- Remove non-native species
### Measuring Extinction Rates
- Species/Area curves: 90% loss in area results in 50% decline in species
- Minimum Viable Population estimates
- Minimum Dynamic Area
- Population Viability Analysis: Risk assessment analysis to determine persistence of a population
### Minimum Viable Population
- Smallest number of individuals necessary to ensure population survival in a region for a specific time period
- Most indicate a few thousand individuals are necessary for survival beyond a few decades
### Minimum Dynamic Area
- Minimum area of suitable habitat needed to maintain MVP
- Most small animals require 100-1000 square km
- 50 grizzly bears need 49000 square km
### Population Viability Analysis
- Risk assessment model predicting viability of a population for a number of generations
- Based on current resource needs and habitat conditions, genetic variability, reproduction rate, interaction with other species
### Type of Extinction
- Local Extinction: Species no longer found in an area but still exists globally
- Ecological Extinction: So Few remaining members of a species exists it no longer plays a role in ecosystem
- Biological Extinction: Species no longer found
### Species Prone to Extinction
- Low reproductive rate
- Specialized niche
- Narrow distribution
- Fixed migratory patterns
- Commercially valuable
- Require large territories
#### Factors Leading to Decline in Species
- Environmental Stress  
- Large Environmental Disturbance  
- Extreme Environmental Conditions  
- Resource Limitations  
- Invasive non-native species  
- Geographic Isolation
### Mass Extinction
- Loss of a significant number of species in short period of time lack of speciation to replace them
- 5 mass extinctions in history where 50% of animal species were wiped out
- All related to some form of climate change
- Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction 65 MYA 16% Marine families 47% marine Genera 18% land vertebrates including the dinosaurs caused by asteroids
- End of Triassic 199-210 MYA 52% Marine Genera Volcanic Activity, formation of Atlantic Ocean
- Permian Triassic Extinction 251 MYA 95% of all species possibly asteroid impact
- Late Devonian 364 MYA 57% Marine Genera Cause unknown
- Ordovician Silurian extinction 439 MYA 50% Marine Genera caused by decline in sea levels due to glaciation
