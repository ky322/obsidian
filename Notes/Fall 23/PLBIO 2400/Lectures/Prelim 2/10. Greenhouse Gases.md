- Greenhouse gases absorb outgoing IR radiation
- The greenhouse effect may provide a link between the anthropogenic production of greenhouse gases and recent climate change
- What are the major greenhouse gases?
	- Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, chlorofluorocarbons
- All but chlorofluorocarbons have both natural and anthropogenic inputs; chlorofluorocarbons are anthropogenic only
- Factors determining the rate of increase of greenhouse gases
- Input sources -> atmosphere -> losses (sinks)
- Accumulation rate = rate of input - rate of losses; not steady state condition
- Chlorofluorocarbons
	- Anthropogenic (chemical industry, refrigerants, propellants) -> atmosphere -> photochemical decomposition (reactions with water, ozone)
	- Lifetime in atmosphere: 10400 years; Accumulation rate: $2.8\times10^4$ tons/year
	- Important greenhouse gas, damaging to ozone
- Methane
	- Natural gas, anaerobic metabolism (natural), animal agriculture (anthropogenic) -> atmosphere -> photochemical decomposition (reactions with water, ozone)
	- Lifetime in atmosphere: 150 years; Accumulation rate: $6.9\times10^8$ tons/year
	- Major greenhouse gas, doubled since 1850
- Carbon Dioxide
	- Respiration (natural), burning fossil fuels (anthropogenic) -> atmosphere -> photochemical decomposition (reactions with water, ozone), photosynthesis (biological)
	- Lifetime in atmosphere: 3 years; Accumulation rate: $3.4\times10^8$ tons/year
	- Major greenhouse gas, $25\%$ since 1850
- Assumption: The total amount of carbon on earth is constant
- There is no creation or destruction of carbon, only interconversion between different forms (pools) of carbon
- A steady state with regard to total carbon but not with regard to atmospheric $CO_2$
- What are the pools that serve as sources for the inputs and sinks for the loss processes?
	- Photosynthesis is a processes that results in a loss of $CO_2$ from the atmosphere; $CO_2$ lost by photosynthesis appears as organic carbon in living matter
	- Photosynthesis and respiration are the main processes that add or remove $CO_2$ from the atmosphere
### The Oceanic Component
- Update from atmosphere is larger than loss to atmosphere
- Surface water loses C to deep ocean waters
- Deep water sequestered from surfaces for 2500 years
- Some loss to sediments, even more removed from atmosphere
### Budget for $CO_2$
- Assume steady state in uptake by photosynthesis = release by respiration
- Non-steady state inputs: combustion of fossil fuels
- The missing $CO_2$ is the difference between the expected concentration of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere based on fossil fuel combustion and the actual atmospheric $CO_2$ levels
- Where is the missing $CO_2$?
	- Terrestrial plants: Lifetime of organic carbon in plants: 1-100 years
	- Soils: Lifetime of organic carbon in soils: 1-1000 years
	- Both limited by how rapidly organic carbon is consumed (food) by other organisms and returned to the atmosphere as $CO_2$; Only short term sinks for carbon
	- In the ocean, processes in the ocean may be sequestering $CO_2$ in pools that interact only slowly with the atmosphere like deep ocean waters (2500 years) or ocean sediments (millions of years)
	- Photosynthesis in the ocean may play a key role in moderating the increase in atmospheric $CO_2$
