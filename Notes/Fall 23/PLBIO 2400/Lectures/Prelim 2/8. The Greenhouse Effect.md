### The Greenhouse Effect and Global Heat Budget
- Components of a heat budget: heat in, heat content, heat out
- Temperature is a direct measure of heat content
- Inputs of heat energy to the earth: Incoming solar radiation
- Minor Inputs
	- Natural decay of radioactive materials
	- Biological systems
	- Human endeavors (fossil fuel burning)
- Average solar energy input to earth: $2\space\mathrm{calories}/\mathrm{cm^2\cdot\text{min}}$ or $500$ trillion calories per minute
	- Time to boil Earth's oceans: 71 days
- Calorie: Measure of heat energy; the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of liquid water by 1 degree Celsius
- A calorie is a measure of energy
- Calorie of human nutrition is equal to 1000 chemistry calories
- The heat energy the Earth absorbs from the sun
	- Heat input from the sun must be balanced by some heat loss processes
	- Total heat absorbed is the total heat lost
- All matter radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation at a rate that depends on its temperature
- The higher the temperature of the matter, the faster it gives up energy
- Electromagnetic radiation: Energy that is propagated through space as an oscillating wave
- Different types of electromagnetic radiation are distinguished by their wavelength; distance between two successive peaks in wave
- Temperature changes the amount of energy and the wavelength (color) of the radiation emitted
	- Lower temperature (25C)
		- Small amount of emission
		- Emission at longer wavelengths
		- Infrared region of spectrum
	- Higher temperature (5000C)
		- Larger amount of emission
		- Emission at shorter wavelengths
		- Visible and UV regions of spectrum
- Sun: Emission in the UV, visible and infrared
- Earth: Emission in the infrared only
- The effect of the atmosphere on the heat budget of the earth
	- Absorbs more incoming short wavelength radiation from the sun; ozone
	- Absorbs more outgoing long wavelength radiation from the earth $CO_2$ and water
	- Net effect: Temperature of the earth increases
- Greenhouse Effect: The absorption of some of the long wavelength emission from the earth by the atmosphere 
- The atmosphere behaves like a glass in a greenhouse; it is transparent to the short wavelength light from the sun but absorbs and reflects the long wavelength radiation emitted by the objects in the greenhouse
	- The earth and the greenhouse get warmer
- Why does the absorption of long wavelength radiation by the atmosphere lead to a higher temperature on Earth compared to the moon?
	- Imagine an Earth with no atmosphere under steady state condition
		- Heat absorbed = heat lost
		- Steady state temperature = -40
	- Add an atmosphere with greenhouse gases
		- Greenhouse gases decrease heat loss
		- Temperature of Earth rises
	- As temperature rises, emission of IR energy rises until new steady state is reached
		- New steady state temperature with greenhouse gases is higher than original steady state temperature without atmosphere
- Is the greenhouse effect bad? No, the earth would be like the moon
- Can rising atmospheric $CO_2$ lead to higher average temperatures because of the greenhouse effect? It can but does not prove a cause and effect relationship between rising $CO_2$ and rising temperature
- What factors lead to uneven heat gain and loss at different places on the surface of the earth?
	- Because the earth is a sphere, the sunâ€™s light hits the surface of the earth at different angles, depending on latitude.
	- In the tropics, the sun is nearly overhead and the rate of energy absorption per unit area is high; high heat input
	- Near the poles, the sun is nearly on the horizon and the rate of energy absorption per unit area is low; low heat input
- In the tropics, more heat is absorbed than is lost
- At the poles, more heat is lost than is absorbed
- Explained by heat transport from the tropics to the poles
