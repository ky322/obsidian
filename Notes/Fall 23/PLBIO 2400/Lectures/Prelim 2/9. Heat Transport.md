### Heat Transport Process
- How much heat is transported between the tropics and the poles?
	- About $1/5$ of the total heat absorbed by the Earth is transported away from where it was absorbed
- How is this heat transport accomplished?
	- Oceanic circulations: currents and atmospheric circulation: wind and weather
	- It is the unique properties of water that account for the majority of this massive heat transport
### Properties of Water
- Thermal properties (absorption and release of heat)
	- Heat capacity
		- Energy to raise 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius
		- Heat capacity of water: 1 cal/gram
	- Latent heat of fusion
		- Energy to melt 1 gram of a substance 
		- Latent heat of fusion of water: 80 cal/gram
	- Latent heat of evaporation
		- Energy to evaporate 1 gram of a substance 
		- Latent heat of evaporation of water: 540 cal/gram
	- Latent heat: Heat added without a change in temperature
- permits the transport of large amounts of heat in the oceans and atmosphere without having big temperature changes
- provides an effective thermal buffer which limits daily and seasonal changes in temperature
### Temperature Effects on Density
- Density mass per unit volume; grams per cubic cm
- Increasing temperature decreases density substance rises compared to surroundings
- Decreasing temperature increases density substance sinks compared to surroundings
- Idealized Atmospheric Transport Model
	- At the equator warm temperatures cause air to rise (less dense)
		- Rising air spread out towards the pole
	- At the poles cold temperatures cause air to sink (more dense)
		- Sinking air spread out on surface towards the equator
	- Convective Cell
		- Warm air aloft transport to poles
		- Cold air at surface transport to equator
		- Transport of sensible heat
		- Determines weather patterns
- Real Atmospheric Transport Model
	- More complex due to rotations of the earth which alters pattern of wind and ocean currents
	- Transport of Latent Heat
		- Evaporation of water at Earth's surface; update of latent heat and cools surface
		- When rising air cools, condensation of water vapor in atmosphere releases latent heat and warms atmosphere
		- Net: Transport of heat from earth to atmosphere
- Weather patterns are driven by heat energy being transported in the atmosphere
	- sensible heat (warm or cold air) or latent heat (as liquid or gaseous water)
	- Weather patterns are chaotic with major variations on time scales of hours, days and seasons.
### Oceanic Circulation Patterns
- Temperature differences between the equator and poles also drives oceanic circulation
- Net result: transport of warm water toward poles and transport of cold water toward equator
- The Gulf Stream Sea Surface Temperature: Flow is chaotic, changes dramatically over periods of weeks to months, difficult to predict
- El Nino Southern Oscillation
	- periodic (3-7 years) accumulation of warm surface waters in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean
	- Southern Oscillation - periodic changes in the position and strength of the atmospheric convection cell just south of the equator in the Pacific Ocean
	- Related events that have global effects on climate, ecosystems, and humans
- Thermohaline Circulation- effect of salinity
	- Cold, dense water sinks to bottom at poles
	- Replaced by rising water at equator
	- Higher salinity equals more dense water
### Summary
- Uneven heating of the earth by the sun drives massive heat transport from the equator to the poles
- Atmospheric transport
	- Pattern of winds, weather (convection cells)
	- Transport of sensible and latent heat 
	- Variability on time scale of hours to days
- Oceanic Transport
	- Surface current
	- Variability on time scale of weeks to months
	- Thermohaline Circulation
- General patterns with lots of variability
- Patterns of heat transport in the atmosphere (weather) and in the oceans (surface currents and thermohaline circulation) are variable on time scales of hours to years
- Climate is the long term average of weather in a specific location
- Climate variation also occurs but on longer time scales from decades to millennia
