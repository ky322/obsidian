### Explanations for Earth Temperature Variations
- Solar output
- Sunspot Activity: 11 year cycles correlate with temperature variations
- 1500 year cycle in solar output
- Early faint sun paradox: Solar output has increased 1/3 since solar system formed
- It is not likely that over the past 150,000 years changes in solar input driven changes in temperature and $CO_2$ rather than $CO_2$ driving temperature changes
### Milankovitch Cycles
- Cycles of variation in the eccentricity obliquity and precession of Earth's orbit
- Some evidence that past variation in climate correlate to Milankovitch cycles
- Eccentricity: How elliptical the orbit is; varies over a 100,00 year cycle, currently decreasing
- Earth farthest from sun: Aphelion
- Earth closest: Perihelion
- Aphelion and perihelion vary least effect on solar input but correlates to greatest climate variation
- Obliquity: degree of tilt of the Earth's axis 41000 year cycle, currently decreasing
- Summer: Earth tilted toward the sun, Earth farthest from the sun (aphelion), winter is the opposite (perihelion)
		- Precession: Wobble or Gyration of Earth on Axis 23000 year cycle. In 15000 years the winter solstice will occur at Aphelion
### Other Factors Which Influence Global Temperatures
- Albedo Effects: Reflectivity of Earth's Surface
- Ice on Earth's surface increases reflectivity
- Atmospheric Turbidity: Effect of suspended particles in atmosphere; Aerosols
### Aerosols
- Absorbs incoming solar radiation can reflect some back into space; global dimming
- Can increase absorption of outgoing radiation and reflect some back
- Can induce cloud formation
