### Climate Trends in the Last 100 Years
- Temperature increase by 0.6 to 0.8 C
	- Not smooth or continuous summers unchanged, winters warmer
- General increase in precipitation
	- Less in tropics more in temperate latitudes significant redistribution of rainfall
- Sea level rise of 15-20cm
	- $25\%$ due to thermal expansion of water $25\%-50\%$ due to melting glaciers, remainder: melting polar ice
### Predictions for the Near Future
- Increasing temperatures (1-4 C)
- Greater changes over land; north hemisphere warmer in winters
- Greater evaporation at higher temperature; major shifts in rainfall patterns
### Solutions Reduction of Emissions
- Decrease emissions of greenhouse gasses; $CO_2$, Methane, CFC
- As much as a political issue as economic and social consequences are considered
- Alternative energy sources
- Green power: wind, solar, hydroelectric
- Nuclear power
- Biofuels: Fuel from recently dead material, no net carbon release
- Hydrogen fuel cells
### Geoengineering and Climate Engineering for Carbon Dioxide Removal
- Reforestation Efforts
- Carbon capture and sequestration: storage below surface on land preferred over oceans
- Biochar production with biofuels
- Reduce incoming solar radiation 
- Enhance reflectivity of Earth's surface
- Spray aerosols in upper atmosphere
- Would see effects quickly, cheaper than carbon removal methods
### Kyoto Protocol 1990s
- Government were separated into two categories
	- Developed countries who accepted greenhouse gas emission reduction obligations and must submit an annual greenhouse gas inventory
	- Developing countries who have no greenhouse gas emission reduction obligation but may participate in the clean development mechanism
- 2008 - 2012 Annex I countries had to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a collective average of $5\%$ below their 1990 levels
- This would be as much as $15\%$ below estimated 2008 levels
- Non Annex I nations had no restrictions but earn carbon credits if they implement greenhouse gas reduction projects
- Annex I nations can buy carbon credits from developing nations
- China and India included as developing countries so not required to reduce emissions
- Largely symbolic: acknowledgement of a problem and required reductions will not do anything to stop climate change
### Paris Climate Agreement
- Limit global temperature rise to 2 C this century, ideally 1.5
- Each nation contributes to its own mitigation protocol
- Nations all commit to financial incentives to reduce reliance on fossil fuels
- Carbon taxes, revenue neutral implemented in Australia and British Columbia
- Cap and trade legislation
