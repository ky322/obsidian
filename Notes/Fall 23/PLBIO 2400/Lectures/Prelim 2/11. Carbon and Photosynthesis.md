### Carbon and Energetics
- The biochemical reactions of life require energy to proceed and enzymes
- Cells use high energy molecules to provide energy for reactions: ATP, NADH, NADPH
- ATP is synthesized through the process of respiration
	- Aerobic respiration
	- 3 step process; occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria
	- Glycolysis: cytoplasm and citric acid (Krebs) Cycle: electron transport: Mitochondria
- The carbohydrates for respiration are produced by photosynthesis
- Conversion of light energy to chemical energy
	- Photosynthesis
		- Two step process: Light reactions and carbon fixation
		- Oxygen produced in the process
		- Light reactions: Light energy absorbed by pigments and converted to chemical energy; ATP and NADPH
		- Chlorophyll: Primary photosynthetic pigment; absorbs mainly blue and red light
		- ATP and NADPH used in carbon fixation to make carbohydrate
	- Carbon Fixation
		- Carbon dioxide reacts with substrate to form simple sugar molecules
		- Carbon fixation step is catalyzed by the enzyme rubisco
		- ATP and NADPH from the light reactions is used in the Calvin Cycle to regenerate substrate
- What environmental factor limits the rate of photosynthesis in any area?
	- Temperature and light, water (most important on land), and nutrient availability (most important on land and oceans)
- Terrestrial have high biomass, cellulose composition of plants, years in residence time of C in plant and algae and years of recycling of nutrients
- Oceanic have low biomass, protein composition of plants, days in residence time of C in plant and algae and days of recycling of nutrients
- Both terrestrial and oceanic have similar total rates of respiration or photosynthesis and similar seasonal distribution
