### Applications of Genetic Engineering
- Most examples of GMO's are in plant systems/agriculture
- Some medical and human examples, largely at the testing stage
	- Gene therapy
		- Insert engineered genes into cells to correct a genetic disorder
		- First test case was in 1990 to treat 
	- Production of insulin and other drugs
	- Vaccines
### Gene Therapy
- Insert engineered gene into cells to correct a genetic disorder
- First test case was in 1990 to treat Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (SCID)
- Disease was caused by a single gene mutation; the body did not produce an enzyme which led to destruction of white blood cells
- Doctors cultured cells from patient's body; inserted functional gene for the enzyme and used transfusions to reintroduce functional cells
- Was successful; Patient needed repeated transfusions monthly for rest of life however
- Most tests through 2006 failed
- Body rejected vector used to introduce gene-immune response
- Gene stops functioning; cells eventually die
- More recent success in the last 5 years in treatment of SCID, inherited retinal disease, Parkinson's
- Treatments are done in somatic cells
- For trait to be inherited, must be inserted into germ line cells which lead to production of gametes
- For this type of result, gene must be inserted at embryonic stage; stem cells
### Germ Line Therapy
- Genetic modification at the embryonic stage of development/ modification of sperm or eggs
- Insertion or removal of genes which are passed on from cell to cell
-  Done in the lab on non-human embryos since the 1980's
- Potential treatment for cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy
- Human Germ Line Therapy banned by AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) since 2000 until ethical issues have been worked out
- Will it be possible to alter genetic makeup to select for specific traits in humans?
### Vaccines
- Take gene that induces immune response in humans, insert it into a harmless virus to create safer vaccines
- Create vaccines directly from genetic material, inject mRNA; Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines
- Edible Vaccines: Incorporate protein to induce immune response into potatoes, bananas; Vaccinate individuals when eaten; Hepatitis-B and cholera
### Organ Transplant
- Transgenic Pigs altered to produce organs which are less likely to be rejected as transplants; xenotransplantation
- Growing organs in tissue culture to be used for transplants; relates to stem cell research
- Cell transplantation therapy (similar to gene therapy); for spinal cord injury and Parkinson's
