### Animal GMO
- Transgenic Mice: Used for research into human diseases
- Transgenic Salmon: grow to market size in half the time of non-transformed
- Farm animals engineered as well to be rapid growing, leaner, or produce useful pharmaceuticals
- Production of infertile individuals to control populations
- Insects: Sterile transgenics or terminator insects bred confer sterility to undesired insects that spread diseases, eat crops
### Plant GMO
- Herbicide Tolerance: Potential to decrease spraying of herbicides
- Insect Resistance: Decrease spraying of pesticides
- Stress tolerance: Resistance to environmental stresses
- Altering quality of food: Nutrition, aesthetic, quality
### Nutrition
- Engineering crops for increases nutrition
- Golden Rice: Engineered for increases beta-carotene; converted in body to Vitamin A
- Engineered beans to alter carbohydrate levels and increased protein levels
### Insect Resistance
- Bacillus Thuringiensis crops: Corn, cotton, potatoes
- Bacillus Thuringiensis: Bacterium that infects insects; protein extracts developed into organic pesticides; 95% of the organic pesticide market in the late 1980's
- Plants modified to produce the Bacillus Thuringiensis protein in leaves, available since 1996
- Lectins: Insecticidal proteins produced by some plants; A lectin from a wildflower species have been inserted into potatoes to deter potato beetles
- Avidin: A protein from egg whites inserted into corn to stop storage pests
### Virus Resistance
- As in most animals viruses are hard to treat in plants
- Viruses are genetic material in a protein coat which inserts itself into cells
- Papaya Ringspot Virus: Gene for protein coat inserted into papayas; conferred resistance to the virus
- Useful for generating virus resistance in other plants
- Some plants have natural resistance to insects, fungi and viruses
- Efforts are being made to transfer resistance from these plants to valuable crop plants
### Herbicide Tolerance
- Generate herbicide tolerance crop plants to allow the use of broad spectrum herbicides on crop fields
- Varieties are developed by chemical companies and marketed with herbicide
- Second Generation herbicide and crop combos are becoming available by other chemical companies
- Often crops are engineered to produce terminator seeds; seeds produced by engineered plants are not viable. Growers needs to buy new seeds each year
### Roundup Tolerance
- Roundup (Glyphosate): A broad spectrum herbicide; disrupts biochemical pathway in the plant which produces a plant-specific essential amino acid
- Breaks down quickly in soil, leaving no residue
- Roundup: Ready soybean, canola, cotton, corn, grass seed, wheat are all available
### Arguments Against GMO's
- Health and safety issues
- Long term problems; escape of genes into wild population; Gene flow
	- Transgenes have been found in wild corn
- Ethical Issues
	- Do we have the right to blur the distinction between species?
	- Dangers of genetic profiling
	- Should we have the right to modify humans, potential for exploitation?
	- Is it ethical to breed animals for xenotransplantation?
- Are they necessary
### Health Issues Related to Technique
- Use of antibiotic resistance genes as markers
- Random insertion into genome; waking up sleeper genes, silencing active genes
- Will gene be stable in the long term
- Potential Allergens: Is the inserted gene safe as food products
	- Brazil nut gene inserted into soybeans in the late 1990's to elevate amino acid content was an allergen
### Build up of Resistant Weeds or Insects
- Spraying with a single pesticide selects for resistant weeds that have less competition; becoming an issue with roundup; ready crops
- Increased resistant insects are also a problem; can be dealt with by some non-resistant crops
### Agriculture
- Potential risks to non target species; could plant producing pesticide harm beneficial species?
- Loss of diversity; potential for invasive species which out compete native species
- Dangers of monoculture: Growing one variety which could be wiped out if novel pathogen arrives; lack of genetic diversity
- Are terminator products fair? Forcing growers to purchase new seeds each year
- Intellectual property rights can slow basic research; no longer an open exchange of information in the scientific community
### Arguments in favor of GMO's
- Exciting possibilities: cure genetic diseases, feed the world, which can improve the quality of life
- Techniques are safe; accelerated traditional breeding
- Ethical issues can be dealt with
- With proper testing safe GMO's can be produced
### Regulation of GMO's
- In the USA, GMO's regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Agriculture (USDA)
	- FDA
		- FDA determines the safety of foods and food ingredients. Although the FDA consults with food developers about their data on the safety and nutrition of GMO's submission of such data to the FDA is voluntary
		- A GMO judged to be substantially equivalent to the existing crop except for its transgene does not require rigorous safety testing
	- EPA
		- The EPA evaluates the effect of pest and herbicide-resistant GMOs on the environment
		- Plants containing pesticide genes are often labeled as pesticides
	- USDA
		- The USDA checks the safety of growing GMOs to learn like whether the transferred genes are stable or whether the GMO might become a pest
