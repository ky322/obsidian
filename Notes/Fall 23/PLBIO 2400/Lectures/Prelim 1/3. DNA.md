### DNA
- Nucleotides: Sugar, phosphate and a nitrogenous base
- Double stranded molecule
- Adenine, Guanine, Purines, Cytosine and Thymine-Pyrimidines
- Base Pairing: AT and CG links strands
- Sequence of bases down strand is the key, information for coding proteins
- Semi- conservative: One strand retained when DNA is copied
- Chromosomes must be duplicated prior to mitosis
- DNA is in the nucleus
- Protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm
- Information must be moved from the nucleus to cytoplasm
### DNA to Protein 
- RNA Ribonucleic Acid: Different sugar one different base
- Messenger RNA (mRNA): Carries information from DNA to cytoplasm for translation into protein (single stranded)
- Transcription: Transfer of information from DNA to mRNA
- Introns: Non coding regions are spliced out
- Exons: Actual coding regions remain
- Cap and poly: A tail added for recognition by ribosome
### Translation
- Synthesis of protein by transfer RNA (tRNA)
- Codon: Three base pairs code for one amino acid
- Protein: Chain of amino acid
- Occurs out in the cytoplasm at ribosomes
- mRNA travels from nucleus to cytoplasm
