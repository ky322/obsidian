- DNA is in the nucleus
- Protein synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm
- Information must be moved from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
### Cells
- Cells divide, expand and then become specialized
- Gene expression plays a role in determining cell fate
- Stem Cells: Fate not determined, can be manipulated
- Totipotency: All cells contain the same genetic information

### Differentiation
- Development of a cell into a specific cell type
- Activation of certain genes result in specialization
- Sexually reproductive individuals have two sets of chromosomes -> Diploid
- Two copies of each gene; one from each parent
- The expression of these genes determine the phenotype

### Control of Gene Expression
- Promoter regions of genes can determine whether or not a gene is activated
- Enhancers and transcription factors
- Enhancers: Regions of DNA to which transcription factors bind
- Transcription Factors are proteins
- Regulatory gene code for transcription factors that activate other genes
- Promoters can be constitutive; Always on
- Promoters can become active at stages of development
- Can become active under certain environmental conditions
- Can be useful for genetic engineering
- DNA Coiling: Gene must be exposed for transcription
- Chemical changes to the structure of DNA can alter gene expression
- Epigenetics: The study of how gene activity is controlled without changing genetic sequences
- Some epigenetic effects can be inherited
- Micro RNA's: Can target mRNA for degradation or disrupt translation

### Transforming an Organism
- Find your gene of interest
	- Buy it
	- Use related gene from other organism if available
	- Find your gene in a library
		- Cut DNA into lots of pieces
		- Insert pieces into plasmids
		- Insert plasmids into bacteria
		- Grow bacteria and multiply fragments
		- Probe cloned fragments to find your gene
- Make copies of your gene; cloning
- Insert it into genome of organism
	- Plants need to deal with cell wall; animal systems only cell membrane
	- Promoters/ Reporter Genes
	- Need some type of marker to identify transformed cells; antibiotic resistance or marker genes
	- Bacterial systems: Protein/ enzyme production
	- Electroporation/ Chemosorption
		- Use electric current or chemicals to make the membrane permeable for your gene to be incorporated into the cell/nucleus 
	- Biolistic: Gene gun
		- Attach copies of gene to small particles and shoot them into cells
	- Microinjection
	- Viruses
	- Agrobacterium tumefaciens: Plant system for transformation
		- Pathogen bacterium that infects plant tissue and induces tumors
		- Incorporates portions of its genome into the plant genome; Causes uncontrolled growth of infected cells
		- Desirable genes can be inserted using non-virulent strains and a reporter gene
- Determine if gene if functional
- Regenerate organism
	- For plants use tissue culture to regenerate organism from transformed cells
	- For animals egg cells are transformed and then fertilized and grown into mature organisms
- Gene editing techniques have superseded traditional methods of transformation
- Still need knowledge of a gene of interest and insertion of a construct to edit the genome
### Restriction Enzymes
- Cut DNA with sticky ends; Useful for splicing fragments together and moving around DNA
### Bacteria Genome
- Bacteria have a single circular chromosome
- Contains plasmids; small circular DNA which are transferred during conjugation (genetic recombination)

### PCR
- Polymerase Chain Reaction: Method to amplify your gene
- Can be used on genomic DNA without making a library
- Uses a special DNA polymerase which works at a high temperature to multiply DNA quickly without bacteria

### Gene Editing
- New techniques allow for targeted insertion of removal of gene sequences
- Crispr-Cas9 system
- Direct editing of genomes now possible

### Reporter Genes
- Produce some visible gene product when present
- Antibiotic resistance genes
- Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) isolated from jellyfish
