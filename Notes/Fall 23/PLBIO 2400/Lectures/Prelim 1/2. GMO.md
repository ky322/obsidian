### Energy in Living Systems
- Life requires a constant input of energy to sustain life and build structure and complexity
- Chemical reactions that make up the biochemistry of life require an input of energy in the form of high energy molecules (ATP) and enzymes (proteins which catalyze chemical reactions)
### Genetic Engineering
- The transfer of genetic information to an organism to introduce a desirable trait
- Result is a transgenic organism or a genetically modified organism (GMO)
### Application of Genetic Engineering
- Most examples of GMO's are in plant systems and agriculture
- Some medical and human examples largely at the testing stage
### Plant Examples of GMO's
- Herbicide tolerance: Potential to decrease spraying of herbicides
- Pesticides in Plants: Decrease spraying of pesticides
- Stress Tolerance: Resistance to environmental stresses
- Altering Quality of Food: Nutrition, aesthetic, quality
### Animal GMO's
- Transgenic mice: Used for research into human diseases
- BioSteel: Gene for silk from spiders inserted into goat eggs
	- Goats developed then produced protein in milk which can be harvested and used as fiber (lightweight and strong)
- Transgenic Salmon: Grow to market size in half of the time of non-transformed
### Medical Examples
- Gene therapy
- Production of Insulin and other drugs
- Vaccines
### Phenotype and Genotype
- Phenotype: Physical appearance of the organism (physical traits)
	- Heritable: passed on to offspring as individuals sexually reproduce
	- Artificial Selection: Through breeding programs desirable traits can be selected and passed on to offspring
	- Novel hybrids can be created
	- Is genetic engineering merely accelerating traditional breeding processes?
		- Genetic engineering can cross the species boundary by introducing genes from different species into an organism
- The genetic makeup of an individual is the genotype
- Genotypes determine phenotype
- The information which leads to a phenotype is contained within the chromosomes
- Genes: Region of the chromosome which carries the information for one trait
- DNA Deoxyribonucleic Acid: Chemical structure of a gene
- Diploid: Sexually reproductive individuals have two set of chromosomes
- Two copies of each gene; one from each parent
- Expression of these genes determines the phenotype
- Chromosomes are found in the nuclei of the cells
- The expression of genes in cells determine the complexity of an organism
- Gene contain information which is passed on to offspring
- The information codes the production of proteins which are structural or enzymes which catalyze the chemical reactions of life
- The biochemical reactions of living organisms determine the phenotype of an organism
- This activity takes place in the cells of the organism
### Cells: The Unit of Life
- Organisms are made up of cells
- Cells are organized into tissues; tissues into organs
- Prokaryotes and eukaryotes: two branches of life
	- Prokaryotes are the simplest form of life
	- Bacteria cyanobacteria
	- Lack complexity of eukaryotes
	- Eukaryotes are more organized and complex
	- Organelles: Membrane bound structures such as nucleus, chloroplasts, and mitochondria
- Cells divide expand and become specialized
- Gene expression plays a role in determining cell fate
- Stem cells: Fate not yet determined and can be manipulated
- Totipotency: All cells contain the same genetic information
### Differentiation
- Development of a cell into a specific cell type
- Activation of certain genes result in specialization
- Mitosis: As cells divide, chromosomes are duplicated and passed on to daughter cells
- Meiosis: The process by which cells divide to form gametes
- Gametes (sperm and egg) contain half the number of chromosomes
- Genetic makeup of gametes is variable
- During sexual reproduction, full complement of genetic material is restored
- Genes contain information which is passed on to offspring
- Information itself codes for the production of proteins which are structural or enzymes which catalyze the chemical reactions of life
