### Constructing QQ Plots 
1. Plot the histogram of the data
2. Select a probability distribution based on the shape of the histogram
3. Let $F(x)$ be the CDF of the selected distribution compute the theoretical quantiles $F^{-1}(q_i)$ 
4. Plot the points $(F^{-1}(q_i), x_i)$ 
The closer that the points $(F^{-1}(q_i), x_i)$ are to the diagonal line $y=x$ the better the fit

- Select a probability distribution whose PDF matches the shape of the histogram
- Use a Q-Q plot to evaluate the fit of your selected distribution
- The closer the Q-Q plot is to the straight line y= x the better the fit
