Continuous Random Variable: A r.v. X where the set X of possible values is an interval or a union of disjoint intervals and have no possible value has positive probability
### Probability Density Functions
- If P(X=x) = 0 for all $x\in X$ how do we compute probabilities of events
- For continuous r.v.’s we use the PDFs instead of PMFs.
1. Take n samples of a continuous r.v. X
2. Draw a histogram of the frequencies of the observed values
3. As n increases the shapes of the resulting histograms approach a function f(x), the PDF of X
- A function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ where
	1. $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$
	2. $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(u)du=1$
- If a continuous r.v. X has PDF f then $$P(a\leq X\leq b) = \int_a^bf(u)du$$ for all $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$
- A r.v. X is uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$ if its PDF is $$f(x)=\cases{1\space0\leq x\leq1\\0}$$
#### Choosing a PDF
1. Plot a histogram of data
2. Select a PDF whose shape matches the shape of the histogram
3. Use statistical tools to check whether your selection is reasonable

### Cumulative Distribution Functions 
- Let X be a continuous r.v. Whose PDF is f. The CDF of X is $$F(x) = P(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^xf(u)du$$
- If f is continuous at $x_0$ then F is differentiable at $x_0$ and $F’(x_0) = f(x_0)$
### Percentiles
- Let $p\in[0,1]$ and let f be the PDF of the r.v. X. The 100pth percentile of X is the number $\nu(p)$ satisfying $$p=P(X\leq\nu(p))=F(\nu(p))=\int_{-\infty}^{\nu(p)}f(u)du$$
### Expectation and Variance
- Same as discrete r.v.’s expect sums are replaced with integrals
$$E(X)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty xf(x)dx$$
$$E(h(X))=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(x)f(x)dx$$
$$Var(X)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty(x-E(X))^2f(x)dx= E(X^2)-E(X)^2$$
#### Properties of E(X) and Var(X)
Same as for discrete r.v.’s for constants $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$
$$E(aX+b)=aE(X)+b$$
$$E(ah_1(X)+bh_2(X))=aE(h_1(X)+bE(h_2(X))$$
$$Var(aX+b)=a^2Var(X)$$
A PDF is symmetric if its graph to the left of some point is the mirror image of its graph to the right of that point. If the PDF f of X is symmetric around c the mean and median equal c

Don’t forget the range when working with PDFs and CDFs!
