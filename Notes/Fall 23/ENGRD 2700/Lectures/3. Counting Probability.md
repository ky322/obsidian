Probability: Number between 0 and 1 that measures how likely it is that an event will occur
Event: Collection of outcomes you are interested in 
When all outcomes are all equally likely, the probability that the given event occurs is $$\text{P(Event)}= \frac{\text{Number of outcomes belonging to event}}{\text{Number of possible outcomes}}$$
Multiplication Rule: If you have $K$ types of things and for type $i=1,2,\cdots,M$ there are $N_i$ items then there are $N_1\times\cdots\times N_k$ ways to select one item of each type
### Permutations 
- Ordered sampling of $k$ items without replacement from a set of $n$ distinct items
- Permutations (Reordering) of a list of $k$ out of $n$ possible items $$P_{k,n} = \dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$
- Combinations: Number of ways to select a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ distinct items or number of unordered samples without replacement $$C_{k, n} = \dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}=\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n}{n-k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}$$
### Hypergeometric Probabilities
Suppose we take a sample without replacement of size $k$ from a population containing $N_1$ Type 1 members and $N_2$ Type 2 members. For $k_1 = 1,\cdots,+ \text{min}\{k,N_1\}$ $$P(\text{get $k_1$ Type 1 Members}) = \dfrac{\binom{N_1}{k_1}\binom{N_2}{k-k_1}}{\binom{N_1+N_2}{k}}$$
Hypergeometric Distribution: Given $N_1, N_2, k$ the probability that this assigns to the number $k_1$ 

### Summary
The number of ways to sample $k$ things from a total of $n$ things:
1. With replacement and order matters $n^k$
2. Without replacement and order matters $P_{k,n}$
3. Without replacement and order does not matter $C_{k_n}=\binom{n}{k}$
