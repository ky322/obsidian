Visual Summaries: Used to summarize and understand data and detect outliers
### Stem and Leaf Plots
- Stems from leading digits and leaves from trailing digit
- Pro: Gives a sense of distribution of the data values at a glance
- Con: Only useful for small datasets

### Scatter Plots
- Useful for understanding relationships between two variables
- To make a scatter plot for two sets of values ${x_1,\cdots,x_n}$ and ${y_1,\cdots,y_n}$ plot the points $(x_1,y_1),\cdots,(x_n,y_n)$
### Time Series Plots
- Given data $x_1,\cdots,x_T$ for times $1,\cdots,T$ its time series plot is the plot of the points $(1,x_1),\cdots,(T,x_T)$

### Dotplots
- Draw a number line and place a dot for each data point, stacking if there are repeats
- Useful for small data sets

### Histograms
For $n$ real valued data points:
1. Find the smallest value $\underline{x}$ and $\bar{x}$ that the data takes
2. Partition the interval $[\underline{x},\bar{x}]$ into disjoint intervals $$l_1=[\underline{x},a_2), l_2 = [a_2, a_3),\cdots, l_{k-1}=[a_{k-1},a_k), l_k = [a_k,\bar{x}]$$
3. For each interval $l_j$ find the number of data points $n_j$ that falls into $l_j$
4. For each interval $l_j$ compute the relative frequency $f_j=\frac{n_j}{n}$
5. For each interval $l_j$ draw a rectangle centered at $l_j$'s midpoint whose area is proportional to $f_j$
Note for $f_j$: $0\leq f_j\leq 1$ and $f_1+\cdots+f_{k-1}+ f_k = 1$

The total area of the histogram's rectangles is 1 if the height of each rectangle is the relative frequency

The total area of the histogram's rectangles is $n$ if the height of each rectangle is the frequency

### Sample Mean
- $\bar{x}$ is the average of the observations $\bar{x}=\frac{x_1+\cdots+x_n}{n}$
- Does not say much about how the data is distributed
- Sensitive to extreme values

### Sample Median
- Measure of location that is less sensitive to extremes (more robust)
- List the sample values $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ in order $\widetilde{x}$ is the middle value of the list if $n$ is odd and average of the two middle values if $n$ is even

### Sample Mode
- Most frequently occurring value(s) in a sample
### Sample Mid-Range
- $\dfrac{\text{largest + smallest observation}}{2}$
- Crude measure of spread (only uses extremes)
- Increases without bound as sample size $n$ grows
- Not useful as a general measure of variability

- Mean, median, and mode differ when the data is skewed ( one tail of histogram is heavier than other)
### Measure of Variability
- How spread the data is
- Sample range, sample variance and standard deviation and interquartile range
- Sample Variance $\sigma^2$
	- Measure data's variability by quantifying how it is spread out around the mean $\bar{x}$
	- $\sigma^2 = \dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2$
- Sample Standard Deviation $\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}$
- If we scale every value by $c$, sample mean is scaled by $c$, sample variance is scaled by $c^2$ and sample standard deviation is scaled by $|c|$

### Order Statistics
- Order Statistics: Given data  $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ largest value of the data
### Quantiles
- A q-quantile of the data  $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ is the smallest number greater than or equal to 100q percent of the values in the data
- A p-percentile is the smallest number that is greater than or equal to the p percent of the values in the data ($(p/100)$ quantile) 
- For the $i^{th}$ smallest value $x_i$ of the data let $q_i = \dfrac{i-0.5}{n}$
- If there is an $i$ where $q=q_i$ then the q-quantile is $x_i$
- If q is between $q_i$ and $q_{i+1}$ the q-quantile is $\dfrac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}$
- if $q\leq q_1$ the q-quantile is $x_1$

### Interquartile Range IRQ
- IQR = (0.75 Quantile) - (0.25 Quantile)
- Less sensitive to extreme values than the range and sample variance and sample deviation
