### Two Sample Tests
- Two cases
	- Two sets of data come from independent experiments
	- Two sets of data are paired. The pairs are independent but there is dependences between outcomes within the pair
### Two Independent Samples
- Assume X and Y iid with mean and variance and X and independent of Y
- E(X-Y)=$\mu_x-\mu_y$ and because independent $Var(X-Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)=\frac{\sigma^2_x}{m}+\frac{\sigma^2_y}{n}$
### Paired Data
- Two observations on the same where $X_i$ and $Y_i$ may be dependent
- Assume $(X_1,Y_1),\cdots,(X_n,Y_n)$ are iid pairs
- $E(X_i)=\mu_x, E(Y_i)=\mu_y, E(X_i-Y_i)=\mu_x-\mu_y$
- $D_i=X_i-Y_i$ is iid with same expectation and variance
	- $E(\bar{D})=\mu_D, Var(\bar{D})=\frac{\sigma^2_D}{n}$
	- We may approximate $\sigma^2_D$ by sample variance $S_D^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(D_i-\bar{D})^2$
- $\mu_D=\mu_x-\mu_y$
