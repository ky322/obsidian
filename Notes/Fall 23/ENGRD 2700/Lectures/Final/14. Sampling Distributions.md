### Statistical Inference
- To answer a question about a population we draw a sample from the population and use the sample to infer things about the population
### Sampling
- Before the data becomes available there is uncertainty about the value of each observation
- We view each observation from the population as a random variable $X_i=1,\cdots n$
- A sample of size n is $X_1,\cdots, X_n$
- The sample mean is also uncertain and viewed as a random variable
- Assume we have a simple random sample 
	- The $X_i$ are independent random variables
	- Every $X_i$ have the probability distribution (same PMF or PDF)
	- $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed
- Statistic: Any quantity that can be computed from the sample data
	- Sample data is uncertain so is statistics
### Sampling Distributions
- The sampling distribution of a statistic is its probability distribution
- Point Estimates of the population quantity: Statistic estimates quantity describing the population
- To get a sampling distribution
	- Assume a distribution for the $X_i$
	- Use this distribution to derive the sample distribution

### Distribution of Sums of Random Variables
- If $X_1,\cdots X_n$ are iid with mean and variance then $E(S_n)=n\mu$ and $SD(S_n)=\sqrt{n}\sigma$
- $E(\bar{X})=\mu, SD(\bar{x})=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
### Central Limit Theorem
- For a simple random sample as n increases the sampling distributions of $S_n$ and $\bar{X}_n$ will appear more bell shaped

- For large samples sizes n the random variable $$\frac{S_n-n\mu}{\sqrt{n}\sigma}$$ is more approximately normal distributed with mean 0 and variance 1
- For large n it is approximately the case $S_n\sim N(n\mu,n\sigma^2)$
