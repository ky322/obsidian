### Known Variance
Before collecting the data:
- $\bar{X}$ is random so the interval $[\bar{X}-\frac{1.96\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X}+\frac{1.96\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}]$ is random
- The probability this random interval contains the true mean $\mu$ is 95%
After collecting:
- Once we observe a particular value $\bar{x}$ of $\bar{X}$ and plug this into the formula for confidence interval we get an interval that is not random

### t-distribution
![[Pasted image 20231202221240.png]]
- It is symmetric and centered at 0
- More spread out has fatter tails
- As $n\rightarrow\infty$ the t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom converges to the standard normal distribution
- For large sample sizes n the t distribution often approximated with the standard normal distribution
- The quantiles $$t_{a,n-1}(1-\alpha)$$ quantile of a t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom are critical values
	- Used to construct confidence intervals for $\mu$ when true mean and true variance are unknown
- To construct a confidence interval with confidence level $1-\alpha$ using $$T=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}$$
	1. Find the critical value $t_{\alpha/2,n-1}$. Then $$P(-t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\leq T\leq t_{\alpha/2,n-1})=1-\alpha$$
	2. Rearranging we get $$P(\bar{X}-t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\leq \mu\leq\bar{X}+ t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\frac{S}{\sqrt{n}})=1-\alpha$$
- If $n\geq 30$ we can use standard normal table
