- Recall our probabilistic regression model $$Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i$$ where the $\epsilon_i$ are iid $N(0,\sigma^2)$ random variables
- Assumes
	1. Y and x are linearly related
	2. $e_i$ are normally distributed and independent
	3. Variances of errors are independent of x
- Standardized residual $$\epsilon_i*=\frac{\epsilon_i}{\sqrt{Var(\epsilon_i)}}=\frac{y_i-\hat{\beta_0}-\hat{\beta_1}x_i}{\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{1-\frac 1 n - \frac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{s_{xx}}}}$$
$\epsilon_1*,\epsilon_n*$ should be iid N(0,1) random variables
### Non Normal Residuals
- Can be identified with normal QQ plots of the standardized residuals
- Improve the model by transforming the data, hypothesizing another relationship between y and x
- Use weighted least squares regression $$\min_{\beta_0,\beta_1}\sum_{i=1}^nw_i(y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i)^2$$
	- Apply a smaller weight $w_i$ to points with larger errors $w_i = \frac{1}{\sigma(x_i)^2}$
### Independent Residuals
- To test if errors are independent can plot standardized residuals with respect to x
	- If independence holds no trend in the plot
### Multiple Linear Regression
$$\min_{\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3}\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-\beta_0-\beta_1x_i-\beta_2x_{i2}-\beta_3x_{i3})^2$$
### Optimal Coefficient

### Polynomial Regression
- Variant of multiple linear regression $$y_i=\beta_0-\beta_1x_i-\beta_2x_{i}^2-\beta_3x_{i}^3+\epsilon_i$$
### Summary
- Plot the standardized residual to diagnose problems. Should see a rectangular band with no clear patterns
- Patterns suggest the need to transform the data
- Heteroscedasticity means the variance is not constant; Fixed by weighted least-squares regression
- Can regress on more than one variable but do not overfit
	- More variables improved fit but risks overfitting
