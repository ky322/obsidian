Probability Model: Describes an experiment or phenomenon where the outcome is not known in advance or cannot be predicted with certainty
- Sample Space S: Contains all the possible outcomes
- Set of Events E: Subsets of S
- Probability Function P: Assigns possibilities (Numbers between 0 and 1) to events
Example: Probability model for flipping a fair coin
- Sample space: {heads, tails}
- Set of events: {$\emptyset$, {heads}, {tails}, S}
- P: $P(\emptyset)= 0$, P({heads}) = 0.5 P({tails}) = 0.5 P(S) = 1

### Events
Subset of possible outcomes that has a probability assigned to it

### Set Manipulation
Let A and B be events (sets)
- $A\cap B$: Set of all outcomes that are in both A and B
- $A\cup B$ Set of all outcomes that are in A or B
- $A^c$ Set of all outcomes that are not in A
For a sequence $A_1,A_2,\cdots$ of events
- $\cap_{i=1}^\infty$: Set of all outcomes in $A_1$ and $A_2$ and so on
- $\cup_{i=1}^\infty$: Set of all outcomes in $A_1$ or $A_2$ and so on
- De Morgan's Laws: For any sequence $A_1,A_2,\cdots$ of events
	- $(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i)^c = \cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i^c$
	- $(\cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i)^c = \cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i^c$

### Probability Functions
Function $P(.)$ that assigns a number between 0 and 1 to every event that satisfies the axioms of probability
1. $P(A)\geq 0$ for every event A
2. If the events $A_1,A_2,\cdots$ are mutually exclusive ($A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset$ for all i and j) then $$P(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i)=P(A_1)+\cdots$$
3. $P(S) = 1$
- $P(\emptyset)=0$
- For finitely many mutually exclusive events $A_1,\cdots, A_n$ $$P(A_1\cup\cdots\cup A_n)= P(A_1)+\cdots+P(A_n)$$
- For any event $A$ $$P(A)\leq 1, P(A^c)=1-P(A)$$
- For any two events A and B: $$P(A)\leq P(B) \text{ if A is a subset of B}$$
- Inclusion Exclusion: $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$

### Defining Probability Functions
- When the sample space S is discrete (finite or countably infinite) any assignment of numbers $p_s$ for each outcome $s\in S$ where $p_s\geq0$ for all s and $\sum_{s\in S}p_s=1$ defines a probability function $P$ $$P(A)=\sum_{s\in A}p_s\text{ for each event A}$$
- When $S$ is $\mathbb{R}$ consider a probability density function (pdf) f(x) where $f(x)\geq0\text{ for all}\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)dx = 1$
- To define a probability function $P$ for $[a,b] = \{x\in\mathbb{R}:a\leq x\leq b\}$  let $P([a,b])=\int_a^bf(x)dx$
- Three ways to pick a probability function to use:
	- Symmetry: When we want all outcomes to be equally likely (discrete or continuous)
	- Estimate the probability from the data
	- Theory
