Let A and B be events and suppose $P(B) > 0$
The conditional probability that $A$ occurs given $B$ occurs is $$P(A|B)= \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$
$$P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)$$
$$P(A ∩ B ∩ C ) = P(A)P(B|A)P(C |A ∩ B)$$
### Law of Total Probability
The events A1, . . . , An form a partition of the sample space S if:
1. they’re mutually exclusive (i.e., Ai ∩ Aj = ∅ for all i, j);
2. $\cup_{i=1}^nA_i=S$

If B is an event, and A1, . . . , An is a partition of S, then
$P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B \cap A_i)= \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(B|A_i)P(A_i)$

Bayes’ Rule: Let $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ be a partition of $S$, and let $B$ be an event where $P(B) > 0$. If $P(A_j) > 0$ for all $j$, then

$P(A_i | B) = \frac{P(A_i \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}$
Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ otherwise, $A$ and $B$ are dependent.

A and B are mutually exclusive if A ∩ B = ∅

Mutual Exclusivity implies that two events $A$ and $B$ cannot happen at the same time. It is connected to "Unions" and "ORs," and $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ if and only if they are disjoint

Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be Independent if the outcome of event $A$ doesn't affect the outcome of event $B$ and vice versa. Independence is connected to "Intersections" and "Ands," and $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ if and only if they are independent.

The events $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ are independent if, for every subset $J$ of $\{1, \ldots, n\}$,
$P\left(\bigcap_{j \in J} A_j\right) = \prod_{j \in J} P(A_j)$
