### Difference Between Probability and Statistics
- Probability: Consider some underlying process which has some randomness or uncertainty modeled by random variables
	- Mathematics of deduction
- Statistics: Observe something that has happened and figure out what underlying process would explain those observations
	- Mathematics of inference

### Population VS Sample
- Population: A well defined set of items you are interested in 
- Sample: A well defined subset of a population
- Observation: An individual measurement from a sample

### Statistical Analysis
1. Formulate clear answerable questions about your precisely defined population
2. Collect data that will help answer your questions using a well chosen sampling scheme and experimental design
3. Explore data using graphics and descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, quantiles)
4. Analyze data to draw conclusions about the population

### Type of Samples
1. Simple random sample of size $n$: Each subset of size $n$ of the population is equally is likely to be chosen
2. Stratified Random Sample: Collect random samples from sub-populations of the population
The data from a sample can be real valued, integer valued or categorical 

### Exploratory Data Analysis vs Formal Inference
- EDA: Summarizes main characteristics of data (plots, summary statistics such as mean, median, and variance)
	- Used to get a better qualitative understanding of the data
	- Formulate questions about the data
- Formal Inference: Draw scientific inferences about the population from the data
	- Clinical trails 
	- Hypotheses may come from EDA
