### Chapter 5.3
- A statistic is any quantity whose value can be calculated from sample data and is a random variable
- Sampling distribution: Probability distribution of a statistic
### Random Samples
- The random variables are simple random sample of size n if the random variables are independent and every random variable has the same probability distribution
### Chapter 5.4
- Let $X_1,\cdots X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with a mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
	1. $E(\bar{x})=\mu$
	2. $V(\bar{x})=\sigma^2/n$
	3. $\sigma_\bar{x}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}$
- Let $X_1,\cdots X_n$ be a random sample from a normal distribution with a mean value $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Then for any n $\bar{X}$ is normally distributed 
- Let $X_1,\cdots X_n$ be a random sample from a distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. If n is large $\bar{X}$ has approximately a normal distribution and $T_o$ has a approximately a normal distribution with mean $n\mu$ and normal distribution $n\sigma^2$
### Chapter 5.5
- Given a collection of n random variables $X_1,\cdots X_n$ and n constants the random variable $$Y=a_1X_i+\cdots+a_nX_n=\sum_{i=1}^na_iX_i$$ is a linear combination of the $X_i$

- $E(X_1-X_2)=E(X_1)-E(X_2)$ for any two random variables
- $V(X_1-X_2)=V(X_1)+V(X_2)$ if independent random variables
- If  $X_1,\cdots X_n$ are independent and normally distributed random variable then any linear combination of the $X_i$ also have a normal distribution
